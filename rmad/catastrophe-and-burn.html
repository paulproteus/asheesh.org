       </h1>
		<p>
Time is running out, so tonight's episode will be a double feature.  Rainer Maria's newest 
(2006) album is called <cite>Catastrophe Keeps Us Together</cite>.  These two songs are 
"Catastrophe" (<a 
href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/catastrophe.html#catastrophe">read the lyrics</a> 
and <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/01%20-%20Rainer%20Maria%20-%20Catastrophe.mp3">download 
the song</a>) and "Burn" (<a 
href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/catastrophe.html#burn">read the lyrics</a> and <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/03%20-%20Rainer%20Maria%20-%20Burn.mp3">download 
the song</a>).
</p><p>
These were the two songs they released as previews in the year or so before they actually 
released the album.  "burn-96kbps.mp3" ("First Malcolm mixes") was on their website as a 
preview for a long time, and "Catastrophe" (the album version) was on their website as a 
preview too.  It's also the song they made the music video for the album out of.  So I think 
Rainer Maria considers them flagship songs on the album.  They're tracks 1 and 3 
respectively.
</p><p>
<h4>Catastrophe</h4>
</p><p>
"Catastrophe keeps us together," begins and repeats this song.  It's also the name of the 
album.  This is the first time that Rainer Maria named an album after a song on it.  
R.E.M.'s most recent album is the first time they did that, too.  I hate to be harsh, but I 
do think both are the weakest shows so far from both artists.
</p><p>
To me, the song is musically strong but lyrically weak.  It's vaguely political, asking:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Do you think we could go on forever <br />
when the architects of the war <br />
are handing out the swords? <br />
</blockquote>
</p><p>
But I don't really know what that means.  It's as if that is mentioned to explain why "we", 
"the architects of the world," are "taking it all apart."  I can't get a solid grasp on who 
"we" are.  Catastrophe could keep us together if we're going to meet up in the afterlife 
(c.f., "I'm Gonna DJ at the End of the World" by R.E.M.), or if we're meeting up in this 
life to fight against those who created the catastrohpe.  But there's a sense of leaving the 
world in "taking it all apart."  Not to mention the varied imagery of how we are to find 
each other "at the end" (x3) of the world.
</p><p>
I've said before I've loved internal rhyme or repeated rhythms in Rainer Maria's sung 
lyrics.  Sadly, this song doesn't get to pluck that string in my heart; the repetition of 
phrases like "I've got a plan" are easier than intelligent rhythmic tricks of older songs.
</p><p>
Since Chris poointed out that I was focusing on the lyrics, I've been trying to make some 
notes about the music too.  All I'll say is that I really do like the music in 
"Catastrophe," and the sharpness of the repetitions of "at the end" and "how will you look" 
contribute to its validity as a head-bopper.
</p><p>
<h4>Burn</h4>
</p><p>
The "original" (read: early cut) "burn-96kbps.mp3" that I heard for a year before hearing 
the album version is quite a bit shorter.  Recently I commended Rainer Maria on being able 
to stop songs before they drag on, and I'm sorry to see that they didn't use that ability 
here.  "Burn" is four and a quarter minutes, but nearly the last full minute is repetition.  
They sing it that long in concert, too.  Curiously, the "First Malcolm mixes" version I have 
is only 3:25, nearly eliminating that last whole minute.  Curiouserly, the next song on the 
album is "Bottle", which makes its mark in 2 minutes, 26 seconds, and is no weaker for its 
short length.
</p><p>
Love starts out as as tyrannical fire led by Caithlin in this song, but in a later verse it 
is slightly softened to a sorcery.  "Believing in her" is tantamount to loving her, but she 
-- did what, exactly?  "Didn't know any better" supports the view that she could have 
requited the love but didn't see it in time.  But "I let you down" implies that she could 
have acted differently.
</p><p>
I should look into this further, but I get the feeling that the use of simile ("is like a 
tyranny") and less-than-certain metaphor ("some kind of sorcery") is a much weaker literary 
style for this band than direct comparison and metaphor.
</p><p>
I really wish that the song's lyrics elaborated on the burning or the ways she let this poor 
person down.  I hope that sometime during this blog, I can make a graph showing this song 
(and perhaps the album?) as a statistical outlier in how repetitive it is.  I admit to 
loving some Rainer Maria songs with obscure but tragic lyrics, but here there's not enough 
hints dropped for me to feel as much empathy as before.
</p><p>
As with many Rainer Maria songs, I've built my own meaning.  In a comparison to "Hell and 
High Water," I consider the chance that my variously daily failures are "let[ting] me down," 
and with too many of them I'll feel helpless and watch myself burn.
</p><p>
<h4>More to come</h4>
</p><p>
Yesterday I wrote, "Maybe I'm just a kid who wants easy-to-listen-to pop" out of Rainer 
Maria.  Now you hopefully see that's not actually true. (-: You'll hopefully get the sense 
that while I'm not in love with this album, I'm still happy to have it.  Look for more 
discussion of this album before this blog is over.
