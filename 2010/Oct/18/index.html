</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I move around a lot, and I'm not great at keeping people up to date with what I'm doing. So
here is a change log, most recent last.
</p><p>To <i>really</i> quickly summarize what I'm doing right now, I'm:
</p>
<ul><li> Living in Somerville (within greater Boston), in a lovely space that houses seven great people.
</li><li> Working on <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a> with half my time, and paying the bills the other half by contracting on free software.
</li></ul>
<p>If you care, here's the long form, broken down by time. I could have separated this out in to separate posts, but I'm not going to.
</p>
<h3 id="w_february-through-march-2009">February through March 2009</h3>
<p><a href="http://nelson.freeculture.org/">Nelson</a> called to say he wanted to start a startup. With me.
</p><p>I was reluctant. Within a month of me being in the Bay Area, I met macho, self-assured, self-aggrandizing people 
who seemed to be ambassadors from Startup Land; I quietly found them terrifying and revolting.
By February 2009, I had lived in San Francisco for a year and a half, and startup culture grated on me.
I didn't relish the chance to spend more with those people.
</p><p>But Nelson was <i>very</i> enthusiastic, so I figured if he did most of the work of applying, it was harmless.
He found prospective funder after prospective funder; we applied to <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>
and a few similar programs.
</p><p>Our plan was to create a marketplace for connecting open source developers with <i>end-users</i> of their software.
Those end users would
commit money to fund developers to work on particular features or bug fixes. We weren't naive; we did our research into the litany
of attempts and failures before us. I roped in <a href="http://asheesh.org/note/communication/questions.html">Raffi</a> to help with web
design (an endeavor at which I am useless) and programming, mostly on the basis of the fact that had once styled a Mailman list-info page to look nice.
I honed the idea a little bit, and Raffi and Nelson wrote the applications.
</p><p>Since we were never going to get funding, I also fine-tuned my work life at Creative Commons.
I wanted more time to pursue toy projects without cutting into social time, so I asked them to decrease my hours and let me
take Wednesdays off. Basically, I bought my own 
"<a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2005/12/eric-schmidts-20-percent-time.html">20% time</a>". I took that time to play with
some of my own ideas, like building a website where people could search for files from the free software world
by their MD5/SHA1 hash. (I called this <i>findha.sh</i>. It's not up right now.)
</p>
<h3 id="w_surprise-april-2009">Surprise: April 2009</h3>
<p>Um. <a href="http://shotputventures.com/">Shotput Ventures</a>,
a Y Combinator-type startup incubator based in Atlanta, wanted to fund us. I had nearly forgotten about that whole startup thing,
since I didn't <i>really</i> think that anyone would fund us.
</p><p>The crazy Georgians wanted us to move to Atlanta for the summer.
</p><p>So I dialed Raffi on my phone, and for privacy I stepped into a conference room at Creative Commons. Then we both burst out laughing for about five 
minutes.
</p><p>Here was an opportunity to do a startup, and all I had to do was reply to an email. If I said "Yes," I'd be torn away
from my friends in San Francisco, be forced to face all these terrifying startup Type A people, and intensively build
something during a summer.
</p><p>It was too disruptive to my life for me to say "No."
</p>
<h3 id="w_atlanta-may-2009">Atlanta, May 2009</h3>
<p>Lawrence Lessig gave me a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039378/quotes?qt0478488">mixture of happiness and trepidation</a> when he
wished me good luck and <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/2009/05/creative_commons_needs_a_coder.html">announced</a> to all the zillions
of his readers that I was leaving CC. I took a few weeks to catch up with (and get advice from) friends up and down the northeast
coasts.
</p><p>And then the three of us drove to Atlanta, where for the summer we only worked, slept, and cooked.
Once a week, all the funded companies would meet up for pizza along with our funders. We'd discuss our businesses, practice pitching, and
a guest speaker would share some hard-earned wisdom.
</p><p>I should reflect on our <i>business plan</i>. One core deficiency I noticed in the failed bounties websites
is that they had no community traction. If we were attaching a money-for-code service to Slashdot or an existing space
with lots of open source users and developers, and someone did a <i>really</i> good job of ensuring the community's interactions
were positive, it could work. (Aaron Swarz summarized this as, "There are a lot of businesses that would work if Google launched them.")
That, along with the fact that I'm really interested in the communities and group dynamics
in open source, meant that we built a website that I felt would be a useful community too. I declared that making money
with the website <i>depended</i> on having a large, involved audience. So we set about building the community website I'd be most excited
about building: one for helping people get into open source, and helping projects get in touch with new contributors.
</p><p>As the summer came to a close, Nelson left to pursue other opportunities. Karen was
<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2009/hello-world/">working with us as an intern</a>. Raffi and I were no longer bound to Atlanta, and we wanted to move.
</p>
<h3 id="w_philadelphia-september-2009-august-2010">Philadelphia, September 2009 - August 2010</h3>
<p>Thanks to extraordinarily risk-tolerant family and friends, we secured another small round of funding. Raffi and I moved
to West Philadelphia. That part of the world checked all the boxes: it was close to family and friends, had good public transit, was
friendly to bicycles, and was inexpensive.
</p><p>When we arrived in Philadelphia, the OpenHatch website was a working prototype. We kept working on it; we
fixed the show-stopper bugs in code and usability, and we removed the "invite-only" restriction.
Karen kept interning with us through the end of October.
</p><p>As for <i>life</i>, being in West Philadelphia felt <i>healing</i>. So many friends within a few blocks' radius, and so many of them were great people.
San Francisco triggered my insecurity among the self-confident programmers and businesspeople.
In Philadelphia, I could hide at home with Raffi and just build something I liked.
</p><p>Around March, we were running low on cash to pay our meager rent and food bills.
Raffi and I started using half the hours in the day to do contracting work.
We found a full-time job and split it into two half-time ones.
As contracting goes, the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-fr/2009-December/001468.html">gig</a> was pretty neat: we
helped build and update a free software educational resources search engine for Creative Commons.
</p><p>In terms of personal growth, Raffi was discovering that he wanted to pursue his dream of teaching philosophy.
As Raffi planned out his departure, I reflected on what I wanted for OpenHatch without him.
Helping open source be more attractive to new contributors was the most fulfilling thing
I had ever worked on, so I would definitely keep the project going. But since he was leaving, I no longer needed to "provide for"
anybody else. I could just search the options for the one best suited to me.
</p><p>Raffi helped me make OpenHatch successful by helping with code and design and by being someone else to talk about
OpenHatch with. I had a few friends in the Boston area who care about free software. If I couldn't keep working with Raffi,
I wanted to at least be near other people who care <i>some</i> about OpenHatch, due to their general excitement about
free software.
</p>
<h3 id="w_somerville-september-2010">Somerville, September 2010</h3>
<p>So now I live in Somerville, in a seven person house with consistently awesome people.
We have house
dinners four nights a week, and we keep the kitchen pretty clean. Katie and Will are
vocal proponents of doing what you <i>want</i> in life, rather than spending most of your time
under someone else's management in a full-time job. Their current project is <a href="http://partsandcrafts.org/">Parts and Crafts</a>.
</p><p>My life here comes at a cost: leaving my Philadelphia friends hundreds of miles away, including one ages-old friend
and one <i>really</i> special girl. (There's probably a financial opportunity cost, too, but that bothers me less.)
Most days I'm too "distracted" by the great people here to reflect and miss the fantastic life I left behind.
</p><p>That's because life here really is great. I'm right near so many people who share my passion of ending the
subjugation of software users by programmers.
When I have feedback
for the Free Software Foundation, I can discuss it in person with those people at the weekly free software
meet-up at Grendel's. I have a fortnightly Debian work night scheduled with a fellow Debian developer.
And I'm getting to know so many other sharp, reflective people who care about so many other different things.
</p>
<h3 id="w_where-next">Where next?</h3>
<p>Geographically, I don't yet see a reason I'd leave the Boston area. It's not as centrally located within the northeast
corridor as Philadelphia was, but the community and household are the best I've had so far.
</p><p>Profesionally, I'm happy enough with the 20/20 split. I'd rather be working on open source community outreach
all the time, not just half of it, and I'd rather have more time to review the patches coming in to OpenHatch!
One thing I can look into is having OpenHatch events like the <a href="http://penn.openhatch.org/">recent one at U Penn</a> receive more sponsorship.
Another would be to look for absurdly high-paying contracting in proprietary software, make oodles of cash, and
use that to pay my expenses as I work on OpenHatch full-time for a year or longer.
</p><p>Either way, this self-directed life since San Francisco has been really good. I will always be
indebted to Nelson for ripping me out of
my <a href="http://amitksaha.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/hill-climbing-a-simple-optimization-method/">local maximum</a>.
