        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/slow-mail.html">Mailing lists can wait
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Most of my email comes to me via mailing lists. When someone asks a question or
starts a discussion, I used to jump at the chance to be the first
to reply with an answer. I don't want to unsubscribe; often, I know something
that can move the conversation forward or help someone out. But I'm trying to
allocate more time for myself away from computing these days.
</p><p>So now I let these discussions mature a little before I see them. All mailing list messages
are delivered to a folder called OneDayDelayed. Every night,
my server moves those messages to my INBOX. If someone else has already contributed what I would
have, perfect! If not, I still have a chance to participate.
</p><p>Sometimes, if I have a long backlog of email, I disable that cron job, sometimes for up to two 
weeks.
</p><p>Being able to turn the cron job on and off
really helps; when I have time to deal with mailing lists, I do. Otherwise, I know
the messages will be there when I do have time.
Since this OneDayDelayed change, I've gained have a sense of
calmness and distance from them. I like that. 
</p><p>(Note that if you add me to the CC: line of a mailing list thread, I will see your
message immediately, for better or for worse.)

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/give-them-a-button.html">Let people help your project: Give them a button to click
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>This note goes out to the maintainers and contributors of Free and
open source projects. (Cross-posted
<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/let-people-help-your-project-give-them-a-button-to-click/">at the OpenHatch blog</a>.)
</p><p>I recently had the chance to look at
Mozilla Quality Assurance's research
into 
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/jay/2008/03/28/getting-to-know-the-qa-community-part-2/">the people who help out with testing versions of Firefox</a>.
I saw numbers that really spoke to my experience as a volunteer.
</p><p>On one hand, the vast majority of people put in three or fewer hours a week,
most of whom put in one hour or fewer (such as zero).
</p><p><img src="http://blog.mozilla.com/jay/files/2008/03/currentlyspend.jpg" height="300" width="650" />
</p><p>On the other hand, a huge number <i>wish</i> they could put in a lot more:
</p><p><img src="http://blog.mozilla.com/jay/files/2008/03/wishspend.jpg" height="300" width="650" />
</p><p>Now imagine you're that one-hour-a-week contributor. You have all these other
bits of your life tugging at your time. You want to make sure that when
you sit down to work on free software, you're doing something that really
helps out. Otherwise, not only will you feel bad that you aren't giving
free software as much time as you wish, you'll feel bad that you're not even
making a difference.
</p><p>In my experience, even <i>reading the project mailing list</i> counts toward
that time you're putting into the project. But that doesn't feel productive.
</p><p>So fellow contributors, I have a request for you: Would you be willing to make
it <i>super</i> easy for someone to stand waiting, on guard, for instructions from
you? Imagine if all they had to do is click a button on your website, write a little
bit of info about what they could do, and you would suggest something for them
to work on. Maybe you can offer them a bitesize bug to fix, or maybe you need someone
to download and test the latest version before you release it. If you're handing out
assignments, then part-time contributors don't have to spend their time figuring out
what they should do.
</p><p>I want to tell you that I can <i>give</i> you such a button. It would look like this:
</p><p><img src="https://openhatch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screenshot.png" width="374" height="122" />
</p><p>To get it, you just have to add a little snippet of HTML to your project website.
</p><p>Just go to the <a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/">OpenHatch project list</a>.
and find your project. If it's not there yet, search for it, and click the link
to create it. Then find the box labeled "Have your own website?" and click.
</p><p>Ta-da! HTML source code you can copy-paste. Since OpenHatch itself is an open
source project, we added the button to our own
"<a href="https://openhatch.org/source-code-etc/">source code, etc.</a>" page.
</p><p>When people click it, they appear in a list of "People willing to help" on your
project's OpenHatch page. Like all the friendly faces on the
<a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/Gwibber">Gwibber</a> page.
</p><p>Would you try it, too?

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/post-pycon-2010.html">After "Scrape the Web", 2010
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>As you might remember, I
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon-2010.html">gave my Scrape the Web tutorial</a> again at PyCon this year, 2010.
</p><p>I <i>finally</i> got to publishing the 2010 tidbits on the web. So without further ado:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://blip.tv/file/3359320?filename=Pycon-285.flv">A video of me on blip.tv</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/pycon-2010/scraping-examples.tar.gz">A tar.gz file of code samples</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/pycon-2010/scraping-cheat-sheet.pdf">A brief four-page cheat sheet</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/pycon-2010/scraping-slides.pdf">My full slides, photos, jokes and all</a>
</li></ul>
<p>I also referred to some useful tools in the talk. You might want to check these out:
</p>
<ul><li> Selenium IDE, for WYSIWYG scraping code generation
</li><li> Selenium RC, for reaching right into a web browser and having that do your page loading
</li><li> the everyblock templatemaker (see the cheat sheet)
</li><li> Firequark, for finding CSS selectors of elements on the page
</li><li> FireBug, for the magical "Inspect Element"
</li></ul>
<p>And the old standbys:
</p>
<ul><li> mechanize
</li><li> lxml.html
</li></ul>
<p>My mini feedback for myself:
</p><p>My WP-Hashcash demo didn't go as planned this year, but it's still possible in theory. The attack
in the code still works against last year's version of WP HashCash. Kids, don't upgrade your demo
site the night before your presentation!
</p><p>Speaking of "the night before," again I didn't sleep very much before the talk. I think that worked
better for me last year. In the future, if I basically stay up all night, I should give a talk before
noon.
</p><p>So I actually think <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2022154/">last year's video</a> was probably better, though I haven't watched them in full.
</p><p>Take freely from the code samples and "cheat sheet"!

		<p>Two months ago,
I explained how
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/cosmetic-cc.html">cosmetic carbon copy</a> could allow you
to list recipients in a message who never receive a copy.
</p><p>Today, thanks to <a href="http://www.jstump.com/">John Stumpo</a>'s writing talent and
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~nwf/">Wes Filardo</a>'s IETF-NG, an
Internet-Draft informational document
<a href="http://www.ietfng.org/draft-jhuacm-cosmetic-carbon-copy-01.txt">has been published</a>.
</p><p>IETF didn't like it enough to accept it as an April 1 RFC. (I do actually hope that
one day someone will submit a modified version to IETF as a rest-of-the-year RFC.)
</p><p><a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/04/01/156206/IETF-Drops-RFC-For-Cosmetic-Carbon-Copy">Slashdot took note</a>!
</p><p>In first visible comment, an Anonymous Coward <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1603594&cid=31702090">writes</a>:

<blockquote>
Although it is an April Fool's...this would actually be useful.

</p>
<ul><li> An Anonymous Coward <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1603594&cid=31702204">writes about an existing implementation</a>.
