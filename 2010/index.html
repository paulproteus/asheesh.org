</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I move around a lot, and I'm not great at keeping people up to date with what I'm doing. So
here is a change log, most recent last.
</p><p>To <i>really</i> quickly summarize what I'm doing right now, I'm:
</p>
<ul><li> Living in Somerville (within greater Boston), in a lovely space that houses seven great people.
</li><li> Working on <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a> with half my time, and paying the bills the other half by contracting on free software.
</li></ul>
<p>If you care, here's the long form, broken down by time. I could have separated this out in to separate posts, but I'm not going to.
</p>
<h3 id="w_february-through-march-2009">February through March 2009</h3>
<p><a href="http://nelson.freeculture.org/">Nelson</a> called to say he wanted to start a startup. With me.
</p><p>I was reluctant. Within a month of me being in the Bay Area, I met macho, self-assured, self-aggrandizing people 
who seemed to be ambassadors from Startup Land; I quietly found them terrifying and revolting.
By February 2009, I had lived in San Francisco for a year and a half, and startup culture grated on me.
I didn't relish the chance to spend more with those people.
</p><p>But Nelson was <i>very</i> enthusiastic, so I figured if he did most of the work of applying, it was harmless.
He found prospective funder after prospective funder; we applied to <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>
and a few similar programs.
</p><p>Our plan was to create a marketplace for connecting open source developers with <i>end-users</i> of their software.
Those end users would
commit money to fund developers to work on particular features or bug fixes. We weren't naive; we did our research into the litany
of attempts and failures before us. I roped in <a href="http://asheesh.org/note/communication/questions.html">Raffi</a> to help with web
design (an endeavor at which I am useless) and programming, mostly on the basis of the fact that had once styled a Mailman list-info page to look nice.
I honed the idea a little bit, and Raffi and Nelson wrote the applications.
</p><p>Since we were never going to get funding, I also fine-tuned my work life at Creative Commons.
I wanted more time to pursue toy projects without cutting into social time, so I asked them to decrease my hours and let me
take Wednesdays off. Basically, I bought my own 
"<a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2005/12/eric-schmidts-20-percent-time.html">20% time</a>". I took that time to play with
some of my own ideas, like building a website where people could search for files from the free software world
by their MD5/SHA1 hash. (I called this <i>findha.sh</i>. It's not up right now.)
</p>
<h3 id="w_surprise-april-2009">Surprise: April 2009</h3>
<p>Um. <a href="http://shotputventures.com/">Shotput Ventures</a>,
a Y Combinator-type startup incubator based in Atlanta, wanted to fund us. I had nearly forgotten about that whole startup thing,
since I didn't <i>really</i> think that anyone would fund us.
</p><p>The crazy Georgians wanted us to move to Atlanta for the summer.
</p><p>So I dialed Raffi on my phone, and for privacy I stepped into a conference room at Creative Commons. Then we both burst out laughing for about five 
minutes.
</p><p>Here was an opportunity to do a startup, and all I had to do was reply to an email. If I said "Yes," I'd be torn away
from my friends in San Francisco, be forced to face all these terrifying startup Type A people, and intensively build
something during a summer.
</p><p>It was too disruptive to my life for me to say "No."
</p>
<h3 id="w_atlanta-may-2009">Atlanta, May 2009</h3>
<p>Lawrence Lessig gave me a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039378/quotes?qt0478488">mixture of happiness and trepidation</a> when he
wished me good luck and <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/2009/05/creative_commons_needs_a_coder.html">announced</a> to all the zillions
of his readers that I was leaving CC. I took a few weeks to catch up with (and get advice from) friends up and down the northeast
coasts.
</p><p>And then the three of us drove to Atlanta, where for the summer we only worked, slept, and cooked.
Once a week, all the funded companies would meet up for pizza along with our funders. We'd discuss our businesses, practice pitching, and
a guest speaker would share some hard-earned wisdom.
</p><p>I should reflect on our <i>business plan</i>. One core deficiency I noticed in the failed bounties websites
is that they had no community traction. If we were attaching a money-for-code service to Slashdot or an existing space
with lots of open source users and developers, and someone did a <i>really</i> good job of ensuring the community's interactions
were positive, it could work. (Aaron Swarz summarized this as, "There are a lot of businesses that would work if Google launched them.")
That, along with the fact that I'm really interested in the communities and group dynamics
in open source, meant that we built a website that I felt would be a useful community too. I declared that making money
with the website <i>depended</i> on having a large, involved audience. So we set about building the community website I'd be most excited
about building: one for helping people get into open source, and helping projects get in touch with new contributors.
</p><p>As the summer came to a close, Nelson left to pursue other opportunities. Karen was
<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2009/hello-world/">working with us as an intern</a>. Raffi and I were no longer bound to Atlanta, and we wanted to move.
</p>
<h3 id="w_philadelphia-september-2009-august-2010">Philadelphia, September 2009 - August 2010</h3>
<p>Thanks to extraordinarily risk-tolerant family and friends, we secured another small round of funding. Raffi and I moved
to West Philadelphia. That part of the world checked all the boxes: it was close to family and friends, had good public transit, was
friendly to bicycles, and was inexpensive.
</p><p>When we arrived in Philadelphia, the OpenHatch website was a working prototype. We kept working on it; we
fixed the show-stopper bugs in code and usability, and we removed the "invite-only" restriction.
Karen kept interning with us through the end of October.
</p><p>As for <i>life</i>, being in West Philadelphia felt <i>healing</i>. So many friends within a few blocks' radius, and so many of them were great people.
San Francisco triggered my insecurity among the self-confident programmers and businesspeople.
In Philadelphia, I could hide at home with Raffi and just build something I liked.
</p><p>Around March, we were running low on cash to pay our meager rent and food bills.
Raffi and I started using half the hours in the day to do contracting work.
We found a full-time job and split it into two half-time ones.
As contracting goes, the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-fr/2009-December/001468.html">gig</a> was pretty neat: we
helped build and update a free software educational resources search engine for Creative Commons.
</p><p>In terms of personal growth, Raffi was discovering that he wanted to pursue his dream of teaching philosophy.
As Raffi planned out his departure, I reflected on what I wanted for OpenHatch without him.
Helping open source be more attractive to new contributors was the most fulfilling thing
I had ever worked on, so I would definitely keep the project going. But since he was leaving, I no longer needed to "provide for"
anybody else. I could just search the options for the one best suited to me.
</p><p>Raffi helped me make OpenHatch successful by helping with code and design and by being someone else to talk about
OpenHatch with. I had a few friends in the Boston area who care about free software. If I couldn't keep working with Raffi,
I wanted to at least be near other people who care <i>some</i> about OpenHatch, due to their general excitement about
free software.
</p>
<h3 id="w_somerville-september-2010">Somerville, September 2010</h3>
<p>So now I live in Somerville, in a seven person house with consistently awesome people.
We have house
dinners four nights a week, and we keep the kitchen pretty clean. Katie and Will are
vocal proponents of doing what you <i>want</i> in life, rather than spending most of your time
under someone else's management in a full-time job. Their current project is <a href="http://partsandcrafts.org/">Parts and Crafts</a>.
</p><p>My life here comes at a cost: leaving my Philadelphia friends hundreds of miles away, including one ages-old friend
and one <i>really</i> special girl. (There's probably a financial opportunity cost, too, but that bothers me less.)
Most days I'm too "distracted" by the great people here to reflect and miss the fantastic life I left behind.
</p><p>That's because life here really is great. I'm right near so many people who share my passion of ending the
subjugation of software users by programmers.
When I have feedback
for the Free Software Foundation, I can discuss it in person with those people at the weekly free software
meet-up at Grendel's. I have a fortnightly Debian work night scheduled with a fellow Debian developer.
And I'm getting to know so many other sharp, reflective people who care about so many other different things.
</p>
<h3 id="w_where-next">Where next?</h3>
<p>Geographically, I don't yet see a reason I'd leave the Boston area. It's not as centrally located within the northeast
corridor as Philadelphia was, but the community and household are the best I've had so far.
</p><p>Profesionally, I'm happy enough with the 20/20 split. I'd rather be working on open source community outreach
all the time, not just half of it, and I'd rather have more time to review the patches coming in to OpenHatch!
One thing I can look into is having OpenHatch events like the <a href="http://penn.openhatch.org/">recent one at U Penn</a> receive more sponsorship.
Another would be to look for absurdly high-paying contracting in proprietary software, make oodles of cash, and
use that to pay my expenses as I work on OpenHatch full-time for a year or longer.
</p><p>Either way, this self-directed life since San Francisco has been really good. I will always be
indebted to Nelson for ripping me out of
my <a href="http://amitksaha.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/hill-climbing-a-simple-optimization-method/">local maximum</a>.

Windows Phone 7: The Best Choice For Patent Trolls<br />
<br />
BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Friday, October 8th, 2010 -- The Free<br />
Software Foundation (FSF) today issued a warning to consumers over<br />
Microsoft's upcoming Windows 7 Phone Series. The software release is<br />
backed by a reported 400 to 500 million dollar marketing campaign that<br />
aims to distract consumers from its history of abusive behavior, and<br />
recent actions as a patent troll: attacking free software based phones<br />
like Android.

<p>Hi Peter + FSF,
</p><p>I'm a member, and I just want to say that this email sounds like bizarre<br />
scare rhetoric. Doubly so when there are no details in the email. (Also,<br />
it uses British English even though FSF is an American organization, which<br />
is confusing to my American ear.)
</p><p>"The Best Choice for Patent Trolls" is practically Slashdot-level<br />
flamebait.
</p><p>I understand you are angry, but please remember that your members aren't<br />
always as informed as you. So you have to keep us interested, then inform<br />
us, so we can be on the same page.
</p><p>Phrasing like this just make me uninterested:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Windows 7 Phone Series is another cookie-cutter example of Microsoft's<br />
bumbling maliciousness to everything it does.", said Matt Lee, FSF<br />
campaigns manager
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is "bubling" and "malicious" with "everything it does"? Overgeneralizations<br />
don't help convince; they just amplify existing divides. Anyone reading the email who<br />
isn't already a true believer has just stopped reading.
</p><p>If the point of this email was to be an angry rant, then fine. If the<br />
point was to inform people, explain the FSF's position, and garner support<br />
for the FSF's priorities, then I don't think it worked.
</p><p>You can ask other FSF members what they think, if you want to get a sense.

<blockquote>
"Microsoft's damaging approach to software freedom, coupled with their<br />
utter contempt for customers and developers alike, has produced<br />
yet-another-platform of systematic control. This is a platform designed<br />
only to appease its shareholders and help the folks at the MPAAs and<br />
RIAAs of the world feel better about the chaos they seek to foster<br />
surrounding digital restrictions and other technical folly imposed on<br />
computer users."
</blockquote>
<p>"Yet-another-platform of systematic control" -- I'm confused. What other<br />
platforms of systematic control has Microsoft produced? MS-DOS was a<br />
rather open platform (for its time, and for the PC context), and later<br />
Windows mobile phones had the ability for users to install whatever<br />
software they wanted. Users regularly flash custom firmware onto these<br />
phones. It's proprietary as all get-out, so it's far from perfect; but<br />
it's not "systematic control".
</p><p>So I literally do not know what "other" "platform of systematic control"<br />
Microsoft has made. Honestly.
</p><p>Oh -- now that I'm thinking about it, the Xbox is a good example. I was<br />
involved in the Xbox-Linux project, and I remember all that very well.
</p><p>But the anger in your words actually prevented me from remembering it. No<br />
joke! I've been meaning to write this email to you since last night, and I<br />
couldn't think of an example of an MS "systematic control" platform until<br />
right now.
</p><p>Free software is hugely important to our society. I hope that the FSF<br />
can take this feedback in stride and keep working to inform us about<br />
threats to software freedom.
</p><p>I also decided to publish this at<br />
<a href="http://asheesh.org/note/free-culture/fsf-on-windows-mobile.html">http://asheesh.org/note/free-culture/fsf-on-windows-mobile.html</a> <br />
because I want to see if other people feel the same way I do.

A vivid and creative mind characterizes you.

       </h1>
		<p>Prospective Debian contributors typically follow this process:
</p>
<ol><li> Read the <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/">New Maintainers' Guide</a>.
</li><li> Find something they want to package.
</li><li> Create a package.
</li><li> Email the debian-mentors mailing list asking for someone to review the package, and if it passes review, upload it.
</li><li> Feel increasingly lonely and sad, as the days pass without a reply on the list.
</li><li> (Optional) Blame themselves when no one seems to care, when in fact they submitted a perfectly fine package.
</li></ol>
<p>Okay, so I'm exaggerating that last point. But I'm <i>very</i> interested in improving the culture of Debian, like I promised as follow-ups for that <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/post-shy.html">Debian for Shy People talk</a>.
</p><p>I was talking about the email list on the #debian-mentors IRC channel. I got this vote of confidence from andrewsh:
</p>
<blockquote>&lt;andrewsh&gt; silence is bad</blockquote>
<p>When there are humans involved, silence isn't always golden. So now I have a plan: Niels and I promised that any email to debian-mentors will be answered within <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2010/10/msg00005.html">four days</a>.
</p><p>Maybe we'll say, "Sorry, we all seem to be busy!" Or maybe we'll say, "I'll try to review that next Thursday."
</p><p>The goal is to replace self-doubt and worry among contributors with feedback and clear expectations.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/freed-software.html">When "free software" got a new name
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>On January 30, 1998, Wired.com <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/01/9966">gushed about the ethical underpinnings</a> of the free software movement. The movement was growing:
</p>
<blockquote>Netscape's bold move last week [was] to free the source code of its browser is a prime-time endorsement for no-cost, build-it-yourself software.</blockquote>
<p>The free software movement was in its second decade. In the first decade, corporations learned to tolerate it.
In the late '90s, a transition was underway.
Red Hat was one of the first companies ostensibly founded on free software principles.
But as free software grew, some were concerned that its name was holding it back.
The article explains with a link to a page within <i>gnu.org</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
But "free software" is an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">ambiguous term</a> - there is a difference in meaning between the cultures of PC-based proprietary systems and the 
Net-centric UNIX worlds.
</blockquote>
<p>Michael Stutz, the author of the piece, surveyed the writing of Eric S. Raymond and interviewed luminaries like Bob Young,
Russell Nelson, and Marc Andreessen. The article is about the creation of a new
<i>term</i> for the freely-reusable code produced by the free software movement.
</p>
<blockquote>
As proponents of free software often point out, while this software can be free-of-cost - that is, gratis - the real issue is about freedom, or
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/2.03/features/economy.ideas.html">human liberty</a>. So it is really <i>freed software</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's right -- <i>freed software</i>. The emphasis is in the original.
</p><p>Most of us know the names Eric S. Raymond and Russ Nelson as people involved early-on in
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/board-annotated">the Open Source Initiative</a>. I guess January 1998 is before they
decided on the "open source" name. 
</p><p>Today, the community is divided into people who think it's important to say "free software" and the rest who call it 
"open source." We'd all agree with the following statement from the article:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Freed software is a big win for society in general," said Russell Nelson.
</blockquote>
<p>And that's today's random page from the history books.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/post-shy.html">"Debian for Shy People": What's next
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>What do you do when you have a technical question that you're embarrassed to ask?
</p><p>The first Sunday of Debconf, I led a birds of a feather (BoF) session called
<a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events/620.en.html">Debian for Shy People</a>.
The conference team scheduled it on "Debian Day," a pre-conference day that was open to the public
and still had plenty of Debian Developers in attendance. I just uploaded the slides
to the "Penta" page for the talk.
</p><p>I led it because of my own experience. In 2004 or so, I saw Debian as the cool kids' club,
that awesome project that I wished I could be a part of. By 2006, I managed to get over myself, 
read the New Maintainer's Guide, and find a way to get involved. As of mid 2009, I am a full-blown
Debian Developer. I have
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~jaldhar/rup/index.html">real ultimate power</a>. But I sometimes do still feel
hesitation akin to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Imposter Syndrome</a>".
</p><p>(A bunch of people at Debconf didn't really believe I'm "shy," since I asked a <i>lot</i> of 
questions at the conference. At core, I don't naturally believe that the things I say are
worth hearing, but I patch over this hesitation. Sometimes I speak too much, and then I feel
ashamed of burdening everyone. But anyway, this is about Debconf not, me -- so moving on....)
</p><p>In the past year of being a Developer, one thing I've seen is that other contributors
ask me privately for help. Rather than blast the public lists like debian-mentors, they email
or IRC private-message me, or SMS me, or find me at a Linux Users Group event.
I'm lucky to know these people, and they're lucky to have me as a safe person to ask
questions of. Moreover, Debian is better because these people could move past their confusion to make
a technical contribution.
</p><p>I began the BoF session by talking about when someone asked me for help.
Then I asked,
"How many of you have
someone you can ask embarrassing questions of?" Of the forty people crammed into Schapiro 414,
<i>two people'</i> raised their hands. One person put it plainly, "I don't know anyone else who does Debian."
It reminded me of a fact that
<a href="http://littlegreenriver.com/">Karen</a> discovered when she was doing
market research for us at <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>: the vast majority of free
software programmers know <i>zero</i> other people who do free software. I had seen the figure;
we even used it in a talk to try and convince venture capitalists to fund OpenHatch last year. But I didn't
really <i>feel</i> it until I heard it from a room full of Debian contributors.
</p><p>I structured the BoF in two parts: First, I talked in front of some slides to set the
tone properly, and then we enjoyed open discussion. As I was preparing thoes slides,
Daniel Morais asked me, "What's the point 
of having the session? Why not just come up with some ideas, implement them, and not bother 
also <i>talking</i> about it at the conference?" I had considered this; I decided I wasn't 
self-confident enough to start implementing ideas without talking to people to make sure I 
wasn't the only one who saw a problem. But I discovered another benefit of 
giving the talk: people who want to make Debian more welcoming knew to reach out to me.
</p><p>So here are some thoughts that came from our discussion (and later discussions during the 
conference):
</p>
<ul><li> We need better <b>mentorship</b> in Debian. Truly, mentorship is a personal relationship. Perhaps matching people up into one-on-one groups would be a good idea. KiBi said that doing so using OpenHatch (if we add mentorship-oriented features!) would be a reasonable way to do it.
</li><li> I've heard from quite a few people who would be willing to have more one-on-one relationships with mentees.
</li><li> Everyone (except Manoj) knows that Debian contributors are not born experts. It takes a process of learning and teaching to bring them up to speed.
</li></ul>
<p>I set up an <a href="http://openetherpad.org/shy">Etherpad document</a> on <a href="http://printf.net/">cjb</a>'s OpenEtherpad.org. This is what we learned together:
</p>
<ul><li> "If your level of understanding might be low, but you want development help, then you might not know if #debian-devel is only for people who are already super involved and know everything and therefore you should feel embarrassed."
</li><li> People get anxious over their ability to speak English.
</li><li> Bikeshedding over patches can be a major detractor.
</li><li> "Asheesh talks too fast."
</li></ul>
<p>One idea I had before the BoF was to create a discussion area that was <i>safe</i>
for all questions, even if they seem silly. We talked for a while about what name
that would take, if it were to become a new IRC channel. We reached something of a conclusion,
but in the conference that followed
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~persia">Emmet Hickory</a> offered to help make the debian-mentors IRC
channel friendlyer. I think that's the best direction to take things, so the next step is for him and me
to write up what we want and send a note to the debian-mentors email list explaining our vision.
</p><p>In the Etherpad document, people discussed the idea of doing Debian discussion over XMPP (also known
as Google Talk, also known as Jabber). We weren't sure how such a place would get
critical mass; someone briefly mentioned the idea of an IRC/XMPP gateway. I actually
think this discussion is along a very reeasonable path, namely discovering
what discussion method(s) Debian contributors <i>want</i> to use. (That might explain why
I'm now an admin on <a href="http://forums.debian.net/">forums.debian.net</a>.)
</p><p>We also briefly discussed the idea of an anonymous question-answering service. I realize
now that I'm not going to be able to have time to run that, but I still think it'd be a
really cool idea.
</p><p>Biella would remind me that Debian is already successful at bringing in new contributors. I agree!
As a free software project, we have an enormous number of participants.
This is a really good thing, and we're clearly doing <i>something</i> right. The purpose of this talk
was to figure out how to make contributing to Debian less stressful for those who participate.
</p><p>Truly, a "Debian for Shy People" effort isn't about shy <i>people</i>. It's about the moments
of self-doubt we <i>all</i> have in which we don't know what to do and are too embarrassed
to ask. I think that if the project more friendly, we can find more participants, make better
use of our current ones, and see improvements to our
<a href="http://asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">diversity</a>.
</p><p>Whew, that was long. What do you think of all this?

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>File under: <i>self-indulgent whining</i>
</p><p>I wrote a bit ago about <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/joy-drain.html">joy minus drain</a>.
This morning, a friend put me through something that created a lot of drain.
</p><p>He and I aren't going to see each other for a while. So in the morning, he arrived
and was enthusiastic to hang out with me. Knowing how much I like
the
<a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/lemon-ricotta-pancakes-with-sauteed-apples/">Smitten Kitchen lemon ricotta pancakes</a>,
he asks, "Can you find a recipe for blueberry ricotta pancakes?"
</p><p>I find that recipe and print out a copy. (Actually two, by mistake. But that's okay.)
I head toward the kitchen and, feeling more enthusiastic about the day,
start working on the big pile of dishes that I left from last night. As I do that, he
cooks. Showing forethought, he already has ricotta cheese to use for the recipe.
</p><p>As usual (probably this isn't a good trait), I keep an eye on his cooking.
Things seem to be going fine; he even successfully split the egg yolk from the whites!
I do more dishes, and we talk about what we might do in this last day we'll see each other
for a while.
</p><p>I look back at his bowls, and I notice a few flecks of egg yolk in the whites. I sigh,
knowing what he does not: you can't beat egg whites into stiff peaks if there's
even a drop of yolk in them. I explain this to him, and he thinks it
will be okay. They just won't be super stiff peaks.
</p><p>There's something already draining about this. Something of a let-down. I guess
I'd rather not be around to see this sort of imperfection during the process,
even if the result will be good, because for the rest of the cooking period I'll
be wondering if the result would be better if I had just done it. And you probably
thought I wasn't a perfectionist.
</p><p>But that's not the important bit. A moment later, he gets a phone call. During
that period, I stretch out and relax on the couch. I figure we can get back to our
work in the kitchen when we're together. After the phone call, I learn that
he was scheduled to have lunch with a mutual friend at noon at Magic Carpet.
</p><p>It's 11:45, and the Magic Carpet truck is a 20 minute walk away. The only sensible thing to do, if he's to 
have any chance of keeping his lunch plans, is to drop everything and run out the door.
</p><p><i>Ugh</i>. Utterly lame.
</p><p>Any of the following thoughts might have popped into my head.
</p>
<ul><li> In the future, I'll trust his enthusiasm a little less.
</li><li> If he had just used his <i>brain</i> he could have brought back breakfast, not ricotta cheese, and then we could have had a nice relaxed morning.
</li><li> I have seen this pattern before. I should know better.
</li></ul>
<p>As a consolation prize, he invites me! And I accept. And we hurry and put the pancake batter away in the 
fridge. He needs to bike there to make the time, and not having a bike, asks if he can borrow mine. Blake 
(who happens to be visiting) and I take a few minutes to get ready. After a few blocks, I reflect.
</p><p>I'm hungry, and I don't even know what I want to get done today. Is hanging out at Magic Carpet
with our mutual friend really the top thing on my list? I don't know, and I'm hungry. So I went home.
Blake went on, which was fine with me, and presumably joined them at Magic Carpet. It is a tasty place,
and it's on his way to a train station back to Swarthmore.
</p><p>If I want to be in the business of patching over other people's failure to plan,
I guess I could make a checklist of things to make sure.
</p><p>Well, <a href="http://asheesh.org/scratch/Checklists/Hanging_out">there it is</a>. I'll try to use it
going forward as a drain-avoidance tactic.

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>(Updated a few minutes after posting to clarify what I want.)
</p><p>Lisa was visiting Philadelphia a few months ago. We were walking around 
<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/please-touch-museum-philadelphia">the "Please Touch" Museum</a>.
</p><p>I don't remember how we got on the topic, but suddenly there we were. 
Lisa explained, exasperated, "The planet doesn't need saving. The planet will still be there,
no matter what we do to it! It's humanity that needs saving."
</p><p>On the surface, it's obviously correct: a warming climate won't change the fact that there is
a <i>planet</i> with that climate. There's also a deeper truth that really struck me. I thought about the times I've been
asked to recycle; as far as I can recall,
it's been for a "greener planet." So I asked, "Do you think that, if we talked to people about saving
humanity, rather than the planet, we'd have more success?"
</p><p>"Of <i>course</i>," she replied.
</p>
<h4 id="w_in-short">In short</h4>
<p>I want more people to say things like this: "Look, we're all racing toward the destruction of
civilization. Do you want to contribute to that? No, right? So recycle. Here's
how it helps."
</p><p>In the future, when people ask me to minimize my carbon footprint, I want them to put things
in more dire terms. And when companies talk about how they've "gone green," I want to hear them
say, "We realized that civilization is on the brink of collapse. We decided that we didn't
want to push it along." Some mumbling about how they've "gone green" and that "saves you green"
doesn't make me excited.
</p>
<h4 id="w_why-do-i-hear-save-the-planet-rhetoric">Why do I hear "save the planet" rhetoric?</h4>
<p>With Lisa, I wondered aloud about why we talk about saving the planet.
I don't know a great deal about the history of the words used
by what is now the conservation movement. You might imagine that, if
we were to start a conservation movement today, we would quickly come to Lisa's
conclusion and choose her terminology.
</p><p>Today, instead, I imagine a coalition of many different groups
on a conference call together. Some are promoting a broader sense of
self- and earth-consciousness; closer to the hippie end of the spectrum, they
have the laudable goal of bringing humans in touch with their bodies and the
rest of the physical world we inhabit. I have the sense that these sorts of
people are the inspiration and motivation behind a lot of conservation
activists.
</p><p>It feels good to publicly show allegiance to the people who are one's
inspiration. But if it's true that other people would respond better to appeals
<i>not</i> about the planet, and instead about saving civilization, then I
would say that all this talk about the planet is just holding us back.

</p><p>One of the Gregory Brothers has the following exchange with Katie Couric:
</p><p>Katie Couric: "At the North Pole, new satellite photos show arctic ice is melting <i>so fast</i>"--
</p><p>Gregory Brother: "Oh <i>snap</i>, how fast?"
</p><p>Katie Couric: "Many scientists now predict it will be gone within thirty years."
</p><p>Gregory Brother: "Surely you jest! I'm under cardiac arrest!"
</p><p>When Katie leans in to warn, "Some researchers think, it could disappear in just six," the Gregrory Brother swears.
As she discusses the importance of the polar ice, and how temperatures could rise even faster
after it melts, the Gregory Brother looks increasingly scared.
The segment concludes with Katie Couric's words
(in two-part harmony),
"If we all don't take bold action, and take it soon,
we will find ourselves on <i>very thin ice</i>."

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/reflection/2008-belated.html">2008, in summary
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Here's an old bit of text that, for some reason, I never posted. It's a review of 2008, from the perspective of Asheesh on the first Saturday night in 2009.
</p><p>There are some thoughts in here that I had trouble recognizing. Here are some notes that might help you understand what I was talking about:
</p>
<ul><li> In May 2007, I graduated from <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>, having spent nearly five full years in Baltimore. In July 2007, I moved to San Francisco to start working at Creative Commons.
</li><li> "<b>a new metric</b>": This refers to the <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/joy-drain.html">joy-drain calculus</a>.
</li><li> The teaching I began in 2008 was the Python class I helped Seth with, to EFF employees, and then the Noisebridge/SF-LUG "PYCLASS" that I started all by myself. (This class is continuing in my absence!)
</li><li> The visions of my future self, then, were as a computer science student pushing the field forward and pulling policymakers closer to us. I imagined working with Ed Felten and his Center for Information Technology Policy program at Princeton. I also applied to MIT's Decentralized Information Group. Neither program accepted me. Going forward, the next step would be working with security researchers to get published, but I seem to be busy right now with <a href="http://openhatch.org/">something else</a>.
</li><li> Things I did that were pretty unthinkable to me a few years back: Abstractly speaking, one has to do with minimizing jealousy; the other has to do with causing it.
</li></ul>
<p>Somehow this 2008 restrospective fails to mention probably the singularly best thing I did in 2008: I went to Debconf.
</p><p>And now, some writing from a year and a half ago.
</p><p>8----&lt; CUT HERE &gt;---8
</p><p><b>Two thousand eight</b>
</p><p>"Saturating the metrics."
</p><p>Toward the end of 2007 I was worried I had run out of ambitions. All the things I could have named in 2006 that I would 
have said I wanted, I already had, or I had a clear path to getting. Thinking through it at the time, the list didn't 
even seem very long.
</p><p>You could say that from the summer of 2001 up to the middle of 2007, my path was obvious. I would graduate from high 
school, and I would go to college. I would keep some old friends, and I would have great difficulty with the increasing 
distance between me and some of them.  I would eschew proprietary software. I would be whimsical and earnest, if 
sometimes melodramatic. I would graduate again and again. I would be in a safe, understandable environment that would 
provide me outlets for all these things.
</p><p>Getting out of school takes away that last one. It also takes away a peer group, replacing it with a nebulous concept of 
friends who suddenly aren't all in the same place of life as you.
</p><p>"No one's watching"
</p><p>Around Halloween 2007, I said I felt like no one's watching me. My friends for years aren't around to see what I'm doing, 
and to tell me if I'm crazy or wrong. All they get to hear is what I tell them. If I don't say what is wrong when they 
ask, they'll never know to ask again. They won't be surprised at who they see me walking around with because they'll 
never see me walking around here. "Watching" meant "watching out," like a big brother but not like Big Brother.
</p><p>That was 2007. In 2008, there still aren't people who see me every single day who know me well enough to tell me firmly 
that I'm doing something I should not be. But I don't feel the same sort of loneliness as I did a year before. A few 
really close friends can make a world of a difference for me. I now know enough people here whose struggles and character 
strengths and flaws are familiar to me; I trust them enough that I'm eager to have mine become familiar to them. It helps 
that I really believe that these people care about me; it also helps that I think I can see that care in people. They 
want to know what I'm doing, and they can help me find out how I feel about it. I guess I've learned to smooth over the 
temporal distance between conversations even with close friends.
</p><p>One of those people scared me when she told me she might leave San Francisco. I was saddened, and I wanted to tell her 
all the things I'd miss about her. Before I got a chance to tell her, as I thought about them, I found that I had a lot 
of the characteristics I liked in her. I guess I really like me, and I would sure miss me if for some reason I found 
myself missing.
</p><p>By the middle of the year, I came up with a new metric: not for me, but for my relationships with other people. How much 
joy do I get, like by sharing a smile or a sigh? And how much does the person drain me, like from the anxiety of waiting 
or by our repeated failures to communicate? What a perfect year in which to suddenly lose a particular neediness that 
haunted one friendship.
</p><p>"They try what they're not"
</p><p>There were a couple of things that I did this past year that would have seemed pretty unthinkable to me a few years back. 
One I tried and found it was much more painful than I thought; that taught me a lot. The other was less painful than I 
had expected, and the absence of pain taught me a different sort of terror. In the end, neither of them showed me I was 
someone fundamentally different than who I thought I was, but that certainly wasn't the only possible outcome. Somehow 
these self-experiments of 2008 touched me a lot more deeply than the ones in 2007.
</p><p>"Anything"
</p><p>The other sensation I had a year and a half ago, just as I left college to start working, was, "I could do 
<b>anything</b>." It was overhwelming; suddenly out of college, there was nothing to bind me to anything at all. I could 
program computers, or I could sell ice cream. The realization came to me as a reflection of learning that while Lawrence 
Lessig could keep informing the world about copyright, he would ditch that success entirely and start a new crusade.
</p><p>The overwhelming thing was how empty "anything" was. Let alone a better idea; I couldn't really come up with anything I 
wanted to do other than what I had been doing. I can still keep sliding forward, I knew, but I felt unprepared to 
<b>decide</b> what I would do next.
</p><p>In 2008, I remembered that I like teaching people. I think I should do that more, perhaps in a professional setting. And 
I have a few ideas for visions of my future self; they require the cooperation of others, so we'll see what they say. But 
I've seen the visions with enough clarity to know who to ask, so now I'm waiting on something concrete. And rather than 
just squint at the hazy distant future, some friends helped me gain the self-confidence to apply that to this moment: Of 
<b>course</b> I should try to teach ninth graders about copyright and Creative Commons. Of course I should try to speak to 
the anarchists of Baltimore about it, and (this one finally my own idea) of course I should give a tutorial at the yearly 
PyCon.
</p><p>Suddenly present this year is a sense that I feel comfortable in my skin. I'm really grateful that some of my friends 
seem to have found that for themselves this year, too.

for dinner on Tuesday (June 1), at 7:30 PM. Want to join us?
</p><p>We'll be meeting and eating at an inexpensive, tasty Indian place called

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/joy-drain.html">Joy minus Drain
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Start by picturing someone you know.
</p><p>When you spend time with this person, how much <i>joy</i> do you get? It's okay to include sarcastic jokes, dreamy smiles, sharp political discussions, useful shopping advice, or drunken stupors in this figure. Do you and your friend share a sense of humor? Do you feel good about yourself by hanging out with this person? You can include anything that gives you a sense of fulfillment. Usually you feel this joy when you're actually spending time with the person.
</p><p>Next, add up all the ways this person <i>drains</i> energy from you. Does she show up randomly late in a way that makes planning hard? Does he tell you sad stories that drain you past the point of sympathy and into boredom? Do your personalities clash, leaving you both frustrated and unable to understand each other?
</p><p>Now, subtract: <b>Joy - Drain</b>. If this figure is negative, you're probably better off if you don't spend a lot of time with this person. (If the drain comes from the person's flakiness, there are some useful mitigation strategies: Simply tell the person where you'll be within a time range, and if the person shows up, great. Also, just stop believing the person when he says he'll be there.)
</p><p>High joy, low drain people are a blessing. A relief. Treasure them.
</p><p>There are some more interesting cases. Low joy, low drain people are probably safe to keep around. High joy, high drain people? Oh boy. It's probably okay to keep them, but it's probably also smart to balance them out with other high-joy people. (Relying too much on the high-joy, high-drain people might make your own happiness turbulent. For that reason, it recently occurred to me that it might be bad news to date such people.)
</p><p><b>P.S.</b> While it's sensible to order your <i>own</i> friends this way, it's probably low-joy, high-drain to imagine your friends calculating these functions on you.
</p><p><b>P.P.S.</b> This concept started out as "Joy - Effort," where Effort primarily represented the work needed to successfully arrange a meeting time with the person. Chris came up with the idea of generalizing it.
</p><p><b>P.P.P.S.</b> So long as I'm on firm emotional footing (like I seem to be generally this year), I want my friends to tell me how I cause drain so I can try to improve.
</p><p><b>P.P.P.P.S.</b> Maybe this "Joy - Drain" calculus is obvious to most people. I discovered it in mid-2008 when I was feeling weighed down. Before then, I didn't express a whole lot of intentionality on who I spent time with; a surfeit of high-drain people that summer made that necessary.
</p><p><b>P.P.P.P.P.S.</b> It might be productive to apply this to countries/cities/neighborhoods to live in, jobs to keep or quit, or companies to do business with.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/identity.html">Kat and Asheesh, on identity
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Six months ago, I was talking with Kat. We were talking about talking.
</p><p><b>On imperfection</b>
</p><p>Kat wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I think I have to be very very comfortable around someone to be able to be imperfect around them. <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; (at least, without feeling horribly embarrassed about it) <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; More so if what I'm doing is part of my identity.
</blockquote>
<p>It's safe to be bad at dancing, she explained; she doesn't consider herself a good dancer, so nothing's
at risk.
</p><p><b>On flames</b>
</p><p>I had recently written about
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">diversity in free software</a>. Kat showed me a piece she had written,
but not yet published, on a similar topic. I thought she should simply publish the piece as-is. Instead, she worried:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I feel like I have a hard time getting across what I think without coming across as antagonistic.
</blockquote>
<p>I've felt the same way. Years ago, I told my friend Venkatesh that had sent a flame
to a mailing list we're both on. He retorted that
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/communication/flames.html">my flames lack flame</a>.
</p><p>So then I thought about why I might feel I've written a flame, even when no one else felt that way.
I wrote to Kat:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Expressing oneself is a frustrating experience. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; It may seem like you're taking this out on other people. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; In fact, you're just frustrated. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; And fighting (successfully) your own urges to just be quiet. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; So at the end you'll feel like you fought a battle, and that seems like you wrote something that others would feel is antagonistic.
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe for Kat's writing and my "flames", there was some sort of antagonistic <i>process</i> in which we fought ourselves.
That fight doesn't have a lot to do with the resulting <i>text</i>, so it's invisible to the reader.
</p><p>I think this process might leave us vulnerable in another way: if our urges to stay quiet come from
a sense of isolation, and we manage to stay quiet about that feeling, no one will sympathize with us.
We'll appear to be healthy, active participants in a conversation where we express ourselves.
Other people with a similar "process" for self-expression won't get a chance to empathize.
</p><p>(This is why I'm interested in putting together a Debian for Shy People caucus. I hope my Debconf proposal
for a Birds of a Feather session is accepted!)
</p><p><b>On finding a way out</b>
</p><p>We concluded on a happy note:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I haven't been answering Wikimedia mail for a while. Then I figured out that I don't have to use my real name, so I don't have to answer as someone with responsibility, I can just be some random volunteer. <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; Most of it is silly and trivial. But sometimes I am really able to address someone's concern or change someone's mind, and I forget how good that feels. <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; (There are some real jerks too.) <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I got someone who was being snarky to apologize for being so rude. That was kind of awesome. Sometimes it doesn't take very much to make me happy.
</blockquote>
<p><b>P.S. A note from the archives</b>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/slow-mail.html">Mailing lists can wait
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Most of my email comes to me via mailing lists. When someone asks a question or
starts a discussion, I used to jump at the chance to be the first
to reply with an answer. I don't want to unsubscribe; often, I know something
that can move the conversation forward or help someone out. But I'm trying to
allocate more time for myself away from computing these days.
</p><p>So now I let these discussions mature a little before I see them. All mailing list messages
are delivered to a folder called OneDayDelayed. Every night,
my server moves those messages to my INBOX. If someone else has already contributed what I would
have, perfect! If not, I still have a chance to participate.
</p><p>Sometimes, if I have a long backlog of email, I disable that cron job, sometimes for up to two 
weeks.
</p><p>Being able to turn the cron job on and off
really helps; when I have time to deal with mailing lists, I do. Otherwise, I know
the messages will be there when I do have time.
Since this OneDayDelayed change, I've gained have a sense of
calmness and distance from them. I like that. 
</p><p>(Note that if you add me to the CC: line of a mailing list thread, I will see your
message immediately, for better or for worse.)

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>This note goes out to the maintainers and contributors of Free and
open source projects. (Cross-posted
<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/let-people-help-your-project-give-them-a-button-to-click/">at the OpenHatch blog</a>.)
</p><p>I recently had the chance to look at
Mozilla Quality Assurance's research
into 
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/jay/2008/03/28/getting-to-know-the-qa-community-part-2/">the people who help out with testing versions of Firefox</a>.
I saw numbers that really spoke to my experience as a volunteer.
</p><p>On one hand, the vast majority of people put in three or fewer hours a week,
most of whom put in one hour or fewer (such as zero).
</p><p><img src="http://blog.mozilla.com/jay/files/2008/03/currentlyspend.jpg" height="300" width="650" />
</p><p>On the other hand, a huge number <i>wish</i> they could put in a lot more:
</p><p><img src="http://blog.mozilla.com/jay/files/2008/03/wishspend.jpg" height="300" width="650" />
</p><p>Now imagine you're that one-hour-a-week contributor. You have all these other
bits of your life tugging at your time. You want to make sure that when
you sit down to work on free software, you're doing something that really
helps out. Otherwise, not only will you feel bad that you aren't giving
free software as much time as you wish, you'll feel bad that you're not even
making a difference.
</p><p>In my experience, even <i>reading the project mailing list</i> counts toward
that time you're putting into the project. But that doesn't feel productive.
</p><p>So fellow contributors, I have a request for you: Would you be willing to make
it <i>super</i> easy for someone to stand waiting, on guard, for instructions from
you? Imagine if all they had to do is click a button on your website, write a little
bit of info about what they could do, and you would suggest something for them
to work on. Maybe you can offer them a bitesize bug to fix, or maybe you need someone
to download and test the latest version before you release it. If you're handing out
assignments, then part-time contributors don't have to spend their time figuring out
what they should do.
</p><p>I want to tell you that I can <i>give</i> you such a button. It would look like this:
</p><p><img src="https://openhatch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screenshot.png" width="374" height="122" />
</p><p>To get it, you just have to add a little snippet of HTML to your project website.
</p><p>Just go to the <a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/">OpenHatch project list</a>.

to create it. Then find the box labeled "Have your own website?" and click.
</p><p>Ta-da! HTML source code you can copy-paste. Since OpenHatch itself is an open

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>As you might remember, I
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon-2010.html">gave my Scrape the Web tutorial</a> again at PyCon this year, 2010.
</p><p>I <i>finally</i> got to publishing the 2010 tidbits on the web. So without further ado:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://blip.tv/file/3359320?filename=Pycon-285.flv">A video of me on blip.tv</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/pycon-2010/scraping-examples.tar.gz">A tar.gz file of code samples</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/pycon-2010/scraping-cheat-sheet.pdf">A brief four-page cheat sheet</a>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/pycon-2010/scraping-slides.pdf">My full slides, photos, jokes and all</a>
</li></ul>
<p>I also referred to some useful tools in the talk. You might want to check these out:
</p>
<ul><li> Selenium IDE, for WYSIWYG scraping code generation
</li><li> Selenium RC, for reaching right into a web browser and having that do your page loading
</li><li> the everyblock templatemaker (see the cheat sheet)
</li><li> Firequark, for finding CSS selectors of elements on the page
</li><li> FireBug, for the magical "Inspect Element"
</li></ul>
<p>And the old standbys:
</p>
<ul><li> mechanize
</li><li> lxml.html
</li></ul>
<p>My mini feedback for myself:
</p><p>My WP-Hashcash demo didn't go as planned this year, but it's still possible in theory. The attack
in the code still works against last year's version of WP HashCash. Kids, don't upgrade your demo
site the night before your presentation!
</p><p>Speaking of "the night before," again I didn't sleep very much before the talk. I think that worked
better for me last year. In the future, if I basically stay up all night, I should give a talk before
noon.
</p><p>So I actually think <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2022154/">last year's video</a> was probably better, though I haven't watched them in full.
</p><p>Take freely from the code samples and "cheat sheet"!

       </h1>
		
<p>(<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/what-are-you-avoiding-working-on/">Cross-posted from the OpenHatch blog</a>.)</p>
                <p>I remember working on my first big group programming project back in college. The project involved some web scraping work; I enthusiastically took charge of that part. But a few weeks in, my code just wasn’t working. I felt frustrated and helpless — I’m supposed to be the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon-2010.html">scraping expert</a>, so why couldn’t I fix the problems? I retreated into hiding and didn’t want to think about the group of people or the project.</p>

<p>A week later, I feebly ran <tt>svn update</tt> to see how the project had progressed. “Oh!” I exclaimed to myself. “Someone made the data importer work!” I felt a rush of relief.&nbsp;(While writing this paragraph, I sighed again remembering it.)</p>
<p>When I talked to my teammate George, he mentioned off-handedly&nbsp;that he had fixed it. He didn’t feel any of the anguish I felt or&nbsp;assign me the blame I thought I deserved. I guess if I had just asked&nbsp;for help earlier, I could have skipped the feelings of inadequacy entirely&nbsp;and George would have just fixed the bug.</p>
<p>Half a decade later,&nbsp;I feel the same dread about&nbsp;<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=405762">the lack of Maildir support</a> in Alpine. The bug is three years old! Ugh.</p>

<p>This time, I’m going to ask for help. So I listed the issue on <a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/alpine">the Alpine project page on OpenHatch</a>.&nbsp;To put it there, here’s what I did:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Go to the <a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/">OpenHatch projects list</a> and enter your project&#8217;s name. That will take to your project page.</li> 
<li>Answer the last question, &#8220;What is a bug or issue that you&#8217;ve been putting off, neglecting, or just plain avoiding?&#8221;</li> 
<li>Hit <strong>submit</strong>! We&#8217;ll help you sign in with your Google account or other OpenID.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For those of you who work on Free Software projects, what are the issues that drain <em>you</em> the same way?</p>
<p>No bug tracker I’ve seen has a field that says, “I’m avoiding working on this, and that sucks.” To say <em>that</em>, list the issue on your project’s OpenHatch page.</p>
<p>So join in! What are the issues you don’t want to think about? Once you share them, maybe a fellow developer or a new contributor will come by and help you out.</p>
<p><a href="https://openhatch.org/">Head to OpenHatch</a> and let the world know.</p>
<p>P.S. Do you have any ideas about how we can make these project pages more useful? Let <a href="https://openhatch.org/contact/">us</a> know!</p>

<p>P.P.S. Dear Joey Hess and everyone else, sorry that Alpine still doesn’t have Maildir support.</p>

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Should universities switch away from hosting their own email and join the Google bandwagon?
</p><p><a href="http://stuffthought.tumblr.com/">Adi Kamdar</a> wrote to
the <a href="http://freeculture.org/contact/">Students for Free Culture discussion mailing list</a>
linking us to a
<a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2010/02/09/google-run-yale-e-mail/">Yale Daily News</a>
article discussing an "almost-definite" switch for Yale to Google Apps for Education.
</p><p>Adi asked for thoughts, so here are mine.
</p>
<h2 id="w_privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>One interesting thing about the Gmail option is that, when deployed for 
all students, students have no choice but to let Google read their
official email.
</p><p>Some students might take part in activism that they want to shield from
Google, a corporation with its own interests, or the attackers that
attempt to break into Google's systems (see the recent attacks from
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html">crafty pro-Chinese-government hacktivists</a>).
Before a switch to Gmail, each student could choose if Google was the kind
of company they wanted to share their email with. After a switch to Google Apps, the
choice is made for them.
</p><p>But this highlights a different issue: Before a switch to Google, students
have no choice but to let <i>university administrators</i> read their official
email. That's not necessarily optimal, either. Others have pointed out in
this thread that this option comes with legal advantages with regard to
privacy law. At least that's some consolation.
</p><p>It's still true that students can encrypt their email and make it
difficult for <i>any</i> eavesdropper to figure out the bodies of their emails.
But that's no use for hiding the identities of the people with whom they
communicate -- no email crypto I know hides email addresses.
</p>
<h2 id="w_software-freedom-and-open-standards">Software freedom and open standards</h2>
<p>This is juxtaposed against another difficult situation: Matt Senate wrote
about the sucky Squirrelmail system that Berkeley uses (used?) for
webmail. The fact that SquirrelMail is Free Software is small consolation
for Matt. From his perspective, because it's a hosted web application, he
has no more freedom than he would have with Gmail.
</p><p>At least Berkeley's IMAP server followed standards! That's more than we  
can say for the Gmail IMAP server, which is famous for basically
supporting just enough IMAP for Microsoft Outlook to work.
</p><p>But standards compliance is small consolation. If the university email
server "properly" supports IMAP, but isn't <i>fast</i> or doesn't provide the
new extensions that make threading or search speedy, it's not much relief 
to know that you can use any client you want to slowly read your email.
</p>
<h2 id="w_internet-history">Internet history</h2>
<p>Truth be told, University-hosted Internet services are based on what you
might call the original Internet perspective. The Internet began as a
network of networks. A University was a network island unto itself,
running its own email, news, and Ethernet services. When inter-network
connection was available, you can email people at other institutions. When
it wasn't, well -- the Internet is a useful tool, but it's down
right now. "Don't worry," the admins might tell you,
"you can still read your email with PINE."
</p><p>It used to be that inter-network connectivity was icing on top of the
"real" network a person used.
</p><p>Today, inter-network connectivity is the whole <i>point</i> of a network
connection. How embarrassing for each individual network! To test if our
connections are working, we skip right over the local content and point
our web browsers at a search engine. 
</p><p>Users today aren't satisfied to read their email from imap.institution.edu
and read USENET news-- they thirst for real-time access resources
available beyond the university. Students weren't interested in
the J-Stream service I helped set up at Johns Hopkins; instead they mostly
posted and watched videos at YouTube. They don't really care if the the
student-oriented wiki is based on campus or instead halfway across the
globe (say, in Japan).
</p><p>The original Internet was based on autonomous networks and opt-in routing.
But eventually, all the networks opted in. Users drive everything, and  
when they don't get what they want, they vote with their feet. Companies
like Facebook and Google stand ready and armed to provide
shockingly-efficient services to millions of users who choose them. You
could say that with today's network, the autonomy shifted from the
<i>network</i> to the <i>users</i>.
</p><p>The nice thing about University-run services is that students can organize
and ask for changes, as Fred pointed out. And for people like me, there's
something nice about knowing the person who runs your email system.
</p><p>But if your busy university staff doesn't have time to investigate an
email server with fast full-text indexing, you might wish for change.
Having the university tear down its internal services is a progression
toward seeing its network as simply <i>transit</i>.
</p><p>Imagine the loss of pride. It used to be that the university personally  
ran a system for helping users get what they wanted. As it becomes simply
transit, the staff are just greasing the cogs of a larger, invisible
machine that's easy for users take for granted.
</p><p>Some netizens like me hold email as sacred, a beautiful institution based
on standards and a decision to interoperate. When your university switches
to Gmail, I'll be sadder, but maybe what you'll get is professors who can 
spend more time with students and less time configuring desktop software. 
</p>
<h2 id="w_trade-offs">Trade offs</h2>
<p>Every university has a choice: Pay hundreds of thousands to millions of
dollars a year for dedicated staff to run an in-house email system, or let
Google do it. Think for a moment of what good could come from those
dollars when put to use in other ways for students.
</p><p>Your school could start a switch to all-organic food. It could start
paying more of its employees a living wage. Imagine the travel funding for
student activities that can come from hundreds of thousands a year
well-spent. It could run a massive used textbook clearinghouse to help   
students avoid pouring their dollars into the textbook industry.  
</p><p>And now cry with me. What I've asked you do is to consider sacrificing   
institutional autonomy for cold, hard cash. That's to say nothing of the
ecological benefits or the productivity increases possible from having
Google's paid experts run this part of the computing system.
</p>
<h2 id="w_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Is an official Google email system much different than the reality most
students I know live, which is configuring their student email address to
forward to gmail.com?
</p><p>For those of us who would be sadder with one more push toward centralizing
email with Google -- for those who see it as the behemoth whose size
threatens the decentralization that used to be the core of the Internet --
I ask you to think positive. "See the profit from your loss."
</p><p>I have no conclusions for you, just niggling questions.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/cosmetic-cc.html">Cosmetic carbon copy: The opposite of blind carbon copy
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I propose a new feature for email software: Cosmetic carbon copy. CCC works very
similarly to today's carbon copy feature:  If you put an
address in the CCC: list, when the recipients open the message, they can see
the address. The one difference is that with "cosmetic" carbon copy, the CCC:d
address never recieves the message.
</p><p>An example might illustrate the situation. Let's say someone (Alice) wants to
invite Bob to a movie but doesn't want Charlie to come. She might send this email:
<pre>From: alice@example.com
To: bob@example.com
CCC: charlie@example.com
Subject: MOOOVIEEE!
</pre>
<pre>Hey all my friends, join me for a movie tonight!
</pre>
<p>When Alice sends the email, Bob recives a copy. Bob thinks that Charlie received
a copy, as he will be in the <i>CC</i> list. But Alice's mail software
never sent Charlie a copy. So Alice can relax, knowing that Bob won't forward a copy
to Charlie, since Bob thinks he already received it.
</p><p>Alice and Bob will meet up without Charlie, and Alice will quietly sigh in relief.
</p>
<h3 id="w_how-can-this-work">How can this work?</h3>
<p>Cosmetic carbon copy works on the same principle as blind carbon copy: the contents
of the message are fundamentally independent from the recipients.
</p><p>Saavy email users have used the "blind carbon copy" feature for years.
When you place an address in the BCC list, that address will receive a
copy of the email even though other recipients won't see the address listed.
This allows for a form of privacy between the sender of the email and that
hidden recipient.
</p><p>This works because, like postal mail, email messages are delivered using an
"envelope" that contains the actual recipients. When you compose a message in
Alpine, Gmail, or Thunderbird, you are writing the contents of the envelope. When you
hit send, the mail software looks for email addresses that should receive a copy.
It creates one envelope per address, stuffs the letter inside, and sends the whole
thing on its way through the Internet using a protocol called SMTP. When the recipient
(Bob)'s email system receives it, the letter is pulled out of the envelope and placed in an inbox.
</p><p>Which means the envelope is entirely invisible to Bob, the recipient. Most mail software
puts information about the envelope in email headers. Since each email recipient gets
a separate envelope, In the case of cosmetic carbon copy, Alice's letter <i>claims</i> that
Charlie was on the CC: list. But Bob can never learn that Charlie's copy was never sent.
</p><p>So to implement cosmetic carbon copy, Alice's mail program must understand this rule:
</p>
<ul><li> For each address in the CCC list, copy the message to the CC: list in the email message.
</li><li> Create no new envelopes when sending the message.
</li></ul>
<p>Because of the last bullet point, this "carbon copying" is purely cosmetic rather than functional.
</p>
<h3 id="w_a-possible-privacy-problem">A possible privacy problem</h3>
<p>You might wonder, what happens when Bob hits reply-all to say "Yes, I'm coming"? Then (oh no!)
Charlie might see the invitation.
</p><p>Not a problem: Most of my friends use Gmail, and Gmail users almost <i>always</i> hit Reply instead of
Reply-All. Gmail used to have an experimental option called "Reply All by Default", but thankfully they
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=17ba29692b11ce37&hl=en">removed that option</a>.
</p><p>A future version of this specification might suggest mangling the last "." in the BCC:d email
addresses with the <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2024/index.htm">ONE DOT LEADER</a>
character, which looks like "." but isn't one. That way, even if Bob clicks "Reply all,"
Charlie's email address is subtly incorrect and will bounce.
</p>
<h3 id="w_future-work">Future work</h3>
<p>The story I've told here is marginally simplified so it's understandable to a less-technical
audience. Those who want a more technical version can request I submit an RFC. Perhaps in two
months?

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/great-time.html">"How to have a great time," by Kat Walsh
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mindspillage">sweet girl named Kat Walsh</a>
wrote me an email after I <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/packaging.html">wrote about Debconf</a>.
Perhaps unbeknowst to her, she sent it on my birthday. Only a week before she emailed me,
I had seen Kat at the
<a href="http://conference.freeculture.org/">Free Culture conference in Berkeley</a>. That, too, was a great time;
I helped organize it a little, but the bulk of the work was done by others. (My contribution was some
tech and a lot of housing arrangements.)
</p><p>Anyway, here is what she wrote. It happens that while she wrote it about herself,
I find it completely applies to me. What a nice birthday present!
</p>
<blockquote>
I liked seeing your debconf post. I've been trying to figure out where
that joyous feeling comes from, how to get it, because I'm afraid of
not knowing where to find it. So here's what I think is in common with
thetimes where I've had a great time: <br /><br />
<i>1. Feeling welcome/valued.</i> <br /><br />
I've been to conferences where it felt like people were sticking to
their cliques and I was an outsider and I didn't enjoy them at all.
I've also been to conferences where I didn't know anyone when I got
there and I left with new friends.<br /><br />
(And I should be better about my responsibility to bring others in
this way when I do know people! But I see why people stick to cliques:
it's both hard to venture outside the circle you're comfortable and
hard to risk not spending time with the people you know you like to
potentially have a bad time with someone new. Maybe that's only me.) <br /><br />
<i>2. Feeling like I've accomplished something -- either alone or part of a group.</i> <br /><br />
Giving a talk will usually do it. Being part of a project. Getting a
suggestion and acting on it. Solving a problem. Even something as
simple as introducing two people who need to know each other. But if
something like this doesn't happen it feels like a bit of a fun waste
of time. <br /><br />
<i>3. Being around people who are better than me and full of joy themselves.</i><br /><br />
It's easier to be what I most want myself to be when I am around
people who are already closer to it! People who are kinder, smarter,
more productive, more inspired, more generous, more driven make me
rise closer to that, like myself better, and have a better time. <br /><br />
<i>4. Continuous activity</i> <br /><br />
Every moment being filled well -- either the gathering itself or
outside activities. Or a needed rest! But no long stretches of time
where I'm wishing I were doing something better or thinking I could
have better spent the time at home. <br /><br />

<p>Kat is the kind of person who still, after decades of being around other human beings,
still takes thoughts like this seriously:
</p>
<blockquote>
it's both hard to venture outside the circle you're comfortable and
hard to risk not spending time with the people you know you like to
potentially have a bad time with someone new. Maybe that's only me.
</blockquote>
<p>No, Kat, it's all of us!
</p><p>Anyway, conference organizers can succeed overwhemlingly when they provide for "4. Continuous activity" well. 
I think the rest has to be up to the participants.
</p><p>A serious analysis of these criteria would reveal that they're pretty much true of all of life.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/detecting-stale-wordpress.html">Detecting stale versions of WordPress
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I run a
<a href="http://rose.makesad.us/">personal server</a> that hosts web space for a few friends.
Probably the most popular thing to do with the space is to install WordPress and
run a personal blog.
</p><p>A few days ago, I discovered some attackers were abusing one of the sites.
Once we upgraded the site to the latest version of WordPress, the attack went away.
So I wrote a tool that, every night, emails me a report of the locations of old versions
of WordPress. A sample email:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Current version of WordPress: 2.9</b><br />
<br />
<b>oldroommate has WordPress 2.5 in /home/oldroommate/web/oldroommate.com/</b>
</blockquote>
<p>Eek! WordPress 2.5 is old!
</p>
<h3 id="w_how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>Each time it runs, it looks at <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress.org</a>
to see what the current version is. The code to do that is written in Python and uses lxml.html.
It prints the current version in the report, and it uses it when analyzing WordPress installs.
</p><p>To analyze WordPress installs, it executes <i>locate readme.html</i>, looking for WordPress's tell-tale documentation file. For every 
such readme.html, if it matches a simple regular expression suggesting it's a WordPress readme file, it performs
the following analysis:
</p>
<ul><li> It does some simple <i>sed</i>ing and <i>grep</i>ing looking for the version of WordPress described by that file.
</li><li> If the version detected is older (as calculated by dpkg --compare-versions), it creates a one-line report like the one above about oldroommate.
</li></ul>
<p>If it found any installs of old WordPress, it prints a report like the one blockquoted above to stdout.
</p>
<h3 id="w_how-to-use-it">How to use it</h3>
<p>To get emails, I run it with cron. You can add a stanza like this to your crontab (edit it with <i>crontab -e</i>):
</p>
<blockquote>
@daily cd find-out-of-date-wordpress; ./look.sh
</blockquote>
<p>Ta-da, nightly reports.
</p>
<h3 id="w_to-get-a-copy">To get a copy</h3>
<p>Do a git clone:
<pre>git clone git://git.asheesh.org/find-out-of-date-wordpress.git
</pre>
<p>or browse its <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=find-out-of-date-wordpress.git;a=summary">gitweb</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="w_feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>I'm quite interested to hear what others do to avoid old web apps being attacked. If there's another bit of software
that monitors web apps for needing upgrades, I'd love to hear about it! Obviously if you have feedback on this
tidbit I wrote, let me know.
</p><p>(To me, apt-get doesn't seem to be the answer. Web apps (especially PHP ones) don't usually seem to support
keeping the code in one place with multiple different configuration files. And users get excited about the
latest and greatest and don't want to wait for me to upgrade, and I can't blame them.)
</p><p>If some of you don't like the Python dependency or anything else, I do welcome patches!
