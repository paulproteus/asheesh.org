        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/post-shy.html">"Debian for Shy People": What's next
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>What do you do when you have a technical question that you're embarrassed to ask?
</p><p>The first Sunday of Debconf, I led a birds of a feather (BoF) session called
<a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events/620.en.html">Debian for Shy People</a>.
The conference team scheduled it on "Debian Day," a pre-conference day that was open to the public
and still had plenty of Debian Developers in attendance. I just uploaded the slides
to the "Penta" page for the talk.
</p><p>I led it because of my own experience. In 2004 or so, I saw Debian as the cool kids' club,
that awesome project that I wished I could be a part of. By 2006, I managed to get over myself, 
read the New Maintainer's Guide, and find a way to get involved. As of mid 2009, I am a full-blown
Debian Developer. I have
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~jaldhar/rup/index.html">real ultimate power</a>. But I sometimes do still feel
hesitation akin to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Imposter Syndrome</a>".
</p><p>(A bunch of people at Debconf didn't really believe I'm "shy," since I asked a <i>lot</i> of 
questions at the conference. At core, I don't naturally believe that the things I say are
worth hearing, but I patch over this hesitation. Sometimes I speak too much, and then I feel
ashamed of burdening everyone. But anyway, this is about Debconf not, me -- so moving on....)
</p><p>In the past year of being a Developer, one thing I've seen is that other contributors
ask me privately for help. Rather than blast the public lists like debian-mentors, they email
or IRC private-message me, or SMS me, or find me at a Linux Users Group event.
I'm lucky to know these people, and they're lucky to have me as a safe person to ask
questions of. Moreover, Debian is better because these people could move past their confusion to make
a technical contribution.
</p><p>I began the BoF session by talking about when someone asked me for help.
Then I asked,
"How many of you have
someone you can ask embarrassing questions of?" Of the forty people crammed into Schapiro 414,
<i>two people'</i> raised their hands. One person put it plainly, "I don't know anyone else who does Debian."
It reminded me of a fact that
<a href="http://littlegreenriver.com/">Karen</a> discovered when she was doing
market research for us at <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>: the vast majority of free
software programmers know <i>zero</i> other people who do free software. I had seen the figure;
we even used it in a talk to try and convince venture capitalists to fund OpenHatch last year. But I didn't
really <i>feel</i> it until I heard it from a room full of Debian contributors.
</p><p>I structured the BoF in two parts: First, I talked in front of some slides to set the
tone properly, and then we enjoyed open discussion. As I was preparing thoes slides,
Daniel Morais asked me, "What's the point 
of having the session? Why not just come up with some ideas, implement them, and not bother 
also <i>talking</i> about it at the conference?" I had considered this; I decided I wasn't 
self-confident enough to start implementing ideas without talking to people to make sure I 
wasn't the only one who saw a problem. But I discovered another benefit of 
giving the talk: people who want to make Debian more welcoming knew to reach out to me.
</p><p>So here are some thoughts that came from our discussion (and later discussions during the 
conference):
</p>
<ul><li> We need better <b>mentorship</b> in Debian. Truly, mentorship is a personal relationship. Perhaps matching people up into one-on-one groups would be a good idea. KiBi said that doing so using OpenHatch (if we add mentorship-oriented features!) would be a reasonable way to do it.
</li><li> I've heard from quite a few people who would be willing to have more one-on-one relationships with mentees.
</li><li> Everyone (except Manoj) knows that Debian contributors are not born experts. It takes a process of learning and teaching to bring them up to speed.
</li></ul>
<p>I set up an <a href="http://openetherpad.org/shy">Etherpad document</a> on <a href="http://printf.net/">cjb</a>'s OpenEtherpad.org. This is what we learned together:
</p>
<ul><li> "If your level of understanding might be low, but you want development help, then you might not know if #debian-devel is only for people who are already super involved and know everything and therefore you should feel embarrassed."
</li><li> People get anxious over their ability to speak English.
</li><li> Bikeshedding over patches can be a major detractor.
</li><li> "Asheesh talks too fast."
</li></ul>
<p>One idea I had before the BoF was to create a discussion area that was <i>safe</i>
for all questions, even if they seem silly. We talked for a while about what name
that would take, if it were to become a new IRC channel. We reached something of a conclusion,
but in the conference that followed
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~persia">Emmet Hickory</a> offered to help make the debian-mentors IRC
channel friendlyer. I think that's the best direction to take things, so the next step is for him and me
to write up what we want and send a note to the debian-mentors email list explaining our vision.
</p><p>In the Etherpad document, people discussed the idea of doing Debian discussion over XMPP (also known
as Google Talk, also known as Jabber). We weren't sure how such a place would get
critical mass; someone briefly mentioned the idea of an IRC/XMPP gateway. I actually
think this discussion is along a very reeasonable path, namely discovering
what discussion method(s) Debian contributors <i>want</i> to use. (That might explain why
I'm now an admin on <a href="http://forums.debian.net/">forums.debian.net</a>.)
</p><p>We also briefly discussed the idea of an anonymous question-answering service. I realize
now that I'm not going to be able to have time to run that, but I still think it'd be a
really cool idea.
</p><p>Biella would remind me that Debian is already successful at bringing in new contributors. I agree!
As a free software project, we have an enormous number of participants.
This is a really good thing, and we're clearly doing <i>something</i> right. The purpose of this talk
was to figure out how to make contributing to Debian less stressful for those who participate.
</p><p>Truly, a "Debian for Shy People" effort isn't about shy <i>people</i>. It's about the moments
of self-doubt we <i>all</i> have in which we don't know what to do and are too embarrassed
to ask. I think that if the project more friendly, we can find more participants, make better
use of our current ones, and see improvements to our
<a href="http://asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">diversity</a>.
</p><p>Whew, that was long. What do you think of all this?
