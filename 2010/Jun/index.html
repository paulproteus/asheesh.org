the University of Washington Information School gives some tips for finding information.
They've gone Gaga, tying their own lyrics to recent pop music. For example, they sing:

<blockquote>
Look, your naive searching just ain't gonna get it done, <br />
'Cause when it comes to search, if it's not tough it isn't fun (fun).

<p>My favorite part is the sliding shelf between 3:24 and 3:29. Don't skip to it; wait for it.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/politics/save-the-planet.html">Don't "save the planet"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>(Updated a few minutes after posting to clarify what I want.)
</p><p>Lisa was visiting Philadelphia a few months ago. We were walking around 
<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/please-touch-museum-philadelphia">the "Please Touch" Museum</a>.
</p><p>I don't remember how we got on the topic, but suddenly there we were. 
Lisa explained, exasperated, "The planet doesn't need saving. The planet will still be there,
no matter what we do to it! It's humanity that needs saving."
</p><p>On the surface, it's obviously correct: a warming climate won't change the fact that there is
a <i>planet</i> with that climate. There's also a deeper truth that really struck me. I thought about the times I've been
asked to recycle; as far as I can recall,
it's been for a "greener planet." So I asked, "Do you think that, if we talked to people about saving
humanity, rather than the planet, we'd have more success?"
</p><p>"Of <i>course</i>," she replied.
</p>
<h4 id="w_in-short">In short</h4>
<p>I want more people to say things like this: "Look, we're all racing toward the destruction of
civilization. Do you want to contribute to that? No, right? So recycle. Here's
how it helps."
</p><p>In the future, when people ask me to minimize my carbon footprint, I want them to put things
in more dire terms. And when companies talk about how they've "gone green," I want to hear them
say, "We realized that civilization is on the brink of collapse. We decided that we didn't
want to push it along." Some mumbling about how they've "gone green" and that "saves you green"
doesn't make me excited.
</p>
<h4 id="w_why-do-i-hear-save-the-planet-rhetoric">Why do I hear "save the planet" rhetoric?</h4>
<p>With Lisa, I wondered aloud about why we talk about saving the planet.
I don't know a great deal about the history of the words used
by what is now the conservation movement. You might imagine that, if
we were to start a conservation movement today, we would quickly come to Lisa's
conclusion and choose her terminology.
</p><p>Today, instead, I imagine a coalition of many different groups
on a conference call together. Some are promoting a broader sense of
self- and earth-consciousness; closer to the hippie end of the spectrum, they
have the laudable goal of bringing humans in touch with their bodies and the
rest of the physical world we inhabit. I have the sense that these sorts of
people are the inspiration and motivation behind a lot of conservation
activists.
</p><p>It feels good to publicly show allegiance to the people who are one's
inspiration. But if it's true that other people would respond better to appeals
<i>not</i> about the planet, and instead about saving civilization, then I
would say that all this talk about the planet is just holding us back.
</p><p><b>P.S.</b> From <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBb4cjjj1gI">Auto-Tune The News #2</a>....
</p><p>One of the Gregory Brothers has the following exchange with Katie Couric:
</p><p>Katie Couric: "At the North Pole, new satellite photos show arctic ice is melting <i>so fast</i>"--
</p><p>Gregory Brother: "Oh <i>snap</i>, how fast?"
</p><p>Katie Couric: "Many scientists now predict it will be gone within thirty years."
</p><p>Gregory Brother: "Surely you jest! I'm under cardiac arrest!"
</p><p>When Katie leans in to warn, "Some researchers think, it could disappear in just six," the Gregrory Brother swears.
As she discusses the importance of the polar ice, and how temperatures could rise even faster
after it melts, the Gregory Brother looks increasingly scared.
The segment concludes with Katie Couric's words
(in two-part harmony),
"If we all don't take bold action, and take it soon,
we will find ourselves on <i>very thin ice</i>."

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/reflection/2008-belated.html">2008, in summary
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Here's an old bit of text that, for some reason, I never posted. It's a review of 2008, from the perspective of Asheesh on the first Saturday night in 2009.
</p><p>There are some thoughts in here that I had trouble recognizing. Here are some notes that might help you understand what I was talking about:
</p>
<ul><li> In May 2007, I graduated from <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>, having spent nearly five full years in Baltimore. In July 2007, I moved to San Francisco to start working at Creative Commons.
</li><li> "<b>a new metric</b>": This refers to the <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/joy-drain.html">joy-drain calculus</a>.
</li><li> The teaching I began in 2008 was the Python class I helped Seth with, to EFF employees, and then the Noisebridge/SF-LUG "PYCLASS" that I started all by myself. (This class is continuing in my absence!)
</li><li> The visions of my future self, then, were as a computer science student pushing the field forward and pulling policymakers closer to us. I imagined working with Ed Felten and his Center for Information Technology Policy program at Princeton. I also applied to MIT's Decentralized Information Group. Neither program accepted me. Going forward, the next step would be working with security researchers to get published, but I seem to be busy right now with <a href="http://openhatch.org/">something else</a>.
</li><li> Things I did that were pretty unthinkable to me a few years back: Abstractly speaking, one has to do with minimizing jealousy; the other has to do with causing it.
</li></ul>
<p>Somehow this 2008 restrospective fails to mention probably the singularly best thing I did in 2008: I went to Debconf.
</p><p>And now, some writing from a year and a half ago.
</p><p>8----&lt; CUT HERE &gt;---8
</p><p><b>Two thousand eight</b>
</p><p>"Saturating the metrics."
</p><p>Toward the end of 2007 I was worried I had run out of ambitions. All the things I could have named in 2006 that I would 
have said I wanted, I already had, or I had a clear path to getting. Thinking through it at the time, the list didn't 
even seem very long.
</p><p>You could say that from the summer of 2001 up to the middle of 2007, my path was obvious. I would graduate from high 
school, and I would go to college. I would keep some old friends, and I would have great difficulty with the increasing 
distance between me and some of them.  I would eschew proprietary software. I would be whimsical and earnest, if 
sometimes melodramatic. I would graduate again and again. I would be in a safe, understandable environment that would 
provide me outlets for all these things.
</p><p>Getting out of school takes away that last one. It also takes away a peer group, replacing it with a nebulous concept of 
friends who suddenly aren't all in the same place of life as you.
</p><p>"No one's watching"
</p><p>Around Halloween 2007, I said I felt like no one's watching me. My friends for years aren't around to see what I'm doing, 
and to tell me if I'm crazy or wrong. All they get to hear is what I tell them. If I don't say what is wrong when they 
ask, they'll never know to ask again. They won't be surprised at who they see me walking around with because they'll 
never see me walking around here. "Watching" meant "watching out," like a big brother but not like Big Brother.
</p><p>That was 2007. In 2008, there still aren't people who see me every single day who know me well enough to tell me firmly 
that I'm doing something I should not be. But I don't feel the same sort of loneliness as I did a year before. A few 
really close friends can make a world of a difference for me. I now know enough people here whose struggles and character 
strengths and flaws are familiar to me; I trust them enough that I'm eager to have mine become familiar to them. It helps 
that I really believe that these people care about me; it also helps that I think I can see that care in people. They 
want to know what I'm doing, and they can help me find out how I feel about it. I guess I've learned to smooth over the 
temporal distance between conversations even with close friends.
</p><p>One of those people scared me when she told me she might leave San Francisco. I was saddened, and I wanted to tell her 
all the things I'd miss about her. Before I got a chance to tell her, as I thought about them, I found that I had a lot 
of the characteristics I liked in her. I guess I really like me, and I would sure miss me if for some reason I found 
myself missing.
</p><p>By the middle of the year, I came up with a new metric: not for me, but for my relationships with other people. How much 
joy do I get, like by sharing a smile or a sigh? And how much does the person drain me, like from the anxiety of waiting 
or by our repeated failures to communicate? What a perfect year in which to suddenly lose a particular neediness that 
haunted one friendship.
</p><p>"They try what they're not"
</p><p>There were a couple of things that I did this past year that would have seemed pretty unthinkable to me a few years back. 
One I tried and found it was much more painful than I thought; that taught me a lot. The other was less painful than I 
had expected, and the absence of pain taught me a different sort of terror. In the end, neither of them showed me I was 
someone fundamentally different than who I thought I was, but that certainly wasn't the only possible outcome. Somehow 
these self-experiments of 2008 touched me a lot more deeply than the ones in 2007.
</p><p>"Anything"
</p><p>The other sensation I had a year and a half ago, just as I left college to start working, was, "I could do 
<b>anything</b>." It was overhwelming; suddenly out of college, there was nothing to bind me to anything at all. I could 
program computers, or I could sell ice cream. The realization came to me as a reflection of learning that while Lawrence 
Lessig could keep informing the world about copyright, he would ditch that success entirely and start a new crusade.
</p><p>The overwhelming thing was how empty "anything" was. Let alone a better idea; I couldn't really come up with anything I 
wanted to do other than what I had been doing. I can still keep sliding forward, I knew, but I felt unprepared to 
<b>decide</b> what I would do next.
</p><p>In 2008, I remembered that I like teaching people. I think I should do that more, perhaps in a professional setting. And 
I have a few ideas for visions of my future self; they require the cooperation of others, so we'll see what they say. But 
I've seen the visions with enough clarity to know who to ask, so now I'm waiting on something concrete. And rather than 
just squint at the hazy distant future, some friends helped me gain the self-confidence to apply that to this moment: Of 
<b>course</b> I should try to teach ninth graders about copyright and Creative Commons. Of course I should try to speak to 
the anarchists of Baltimore about it, and (this one finally my own idea) of course I should give a tutorial at the yearly 
PyCon.
</p><p>Suddenly present this year is a sense that I feel comfortable in my skin. I'm really grateful that some of my friends 
seem to have found that for themselves this year, too.
