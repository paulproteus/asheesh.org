</a>
       </h1>
		<p>In West Philadelphia, free software and open source fans are going to meet up
for dinner on Tuesday (June 1), at 7:30 PM. Want to join us?
</p><p>We'll be meeting and eating at an inexpensive, tasty Indian place called
Rice N Spice. It's located at <b>4205 Chestnut St</b>.
</p><p>(Need <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=4205+chestnut+st,+philadelphia,+pa">a map</a>?)
</p><p>It looks like a grocery store, but if you push on forward past the shelves of packaged
goods, there are seats and tables. I'll be there at 7:30 sharp. There's a
<a href="http://openhatch.org/about/">picture of me on the OpenHatch about page</a>.
</p><p>If you live, work, or can get to West Philadelphia and like free and/or open source software,
come on out! And if you can't afford to eat out, just come by and sit with us. It's
quite a casual venue.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/joy-drain.html">Joy minus Drain
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Start by picturing someone you know.
</p><p>When you spend time with this person, how much <i>joy</i> do you get? It's okay to include sarcastic jokes, dreamy smiles, sharp political discussions, useful shopping advice, or drunken stupors in this figure. Do you and your friend share a sense of humor? Do you feel good about yourself by hanging out with this person? You can include anything that gives you a sense of fulfillment. Usually you feel this joy when you're actually spending time with the person.
</p><p>Next, add up all the ways this person <i>drains</i> energy from you. Does she show up randomly late in a way that makes planning hard? Does he tell you sad stories that drain you past the point of sympathy and into boredom? Do your personalities clash, leaving you both frustrated and unable to understand each other?
</p><p>Now, subtract: <b>Joy - Drain</b>. If this figure is negative, you're probably better off if you don't spend a lot of time with this person. (If the drain comes from the person's flakiness, there are some useful mitigation strategies: Simply tell the person where you'll be within a time range, and if the person shows up, great. Also, just stop believing the person when he says he'll be there.)
</p><p>High joy, low drain people are a blessing. A relief. Treasure them.
</p><p>There are some more interesting cases. Low joy, low drain people are probably safe to keep around. High joy, high drain people? Oh boy. It's probably okay to keep them, but it's probably also smart to balance them out with other high-joy people. (Relying too much on the high-joy, high-drain people might make your own happiness turbulent. For that reason, it recently occurred to me that it might be bad news to date such people.)
</p><p><b>P.S.</b> While it's sensible to order your <i>own</i> friends this way, it's probably low-joy, high-drain to imagine your friends calculating these functions on you.
</p><p><b>P.P.S.</b> This concept started out as "Joy - Effort," where Effort primarily represented the work needed to successfully arrange a meeting time with the person. Chris came up with the idea of generalizing it.
</p><p><b>P.P.P.S.</b> So long as I'm on firm emotional footing (like I seem to be generally this year), I want my friends to tell me how I cause drain so I can try to improve.
</p><p><b>P.P.P.P.S.</b> Maybe this "Joy - Drain" calculus is obvious to most people. I discovered it in mid-2008 when I was feeling weighed down. Before then, I didn't express a whole lot of intentionality on who I spent time with; a surfeit of high-drain people that summer made that necessary.
</p><p><b>P.P.P.P.P.S.</b> It might be productive to apply this to countries/cities/neighborhoods to live in, jobs to keep or quit, or companies to do business with.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/identity.html">Kat and Asheesh, on identity
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Six months ago, I was talking with Kat. We were talking about talking.
</p><p><b>On imperfection</b>
</p><p>Kat wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I think I have to be very very comfortable around someone to be able to be imperfect around them. <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; (at least, without feeling horribly embarrassed about it) <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; More so if what I'm doing is part of my identity.
</blockquote>
<p>It's safe to be bad at dancing, she explained; she doesn't consider herself a good dancer, so nothing's
at risk.
</p><p><b>On flames</b>
</p><p>I had recently written about
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">diversity in free software</a>. Kat showed me a piece she had written,
but not yet published, on a similar topic. I thought she should simply publish the piece as-is. Instead, she worried:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I feel like I have a hard time getting across what I think without coming across as antagonistic.
</blockquote>
<p>I've felt the same way. Years ago, I told my friend Venkatesh that had sent a flame
to a mailing list we're both on. He retorted that
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/communication/flames.html">my flames lack flame</a>.
</p><p>So then I thought about why I might feel I've written a flame, even when no one else felt that way.
I wrote to Kat:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Expressing oneself is a frustrating experience. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; It may seem like you're taking this out on other people. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; In fact, you're just frustrated. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; And fighting (successfully) your own urges to just be quiet. <br />
&lt;paulproteus&gt; So at the end you'll feel like you fought a battle, and that seems like you wrote something that others would feel is antagonistic.
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe for Kat's writing and my "flames", there was some sort of antagonistic <i>process</i> in which we fought ourselves.
That fight doesn't have a lot to do with the resulting <i>text</i>, so it's invisible to the reader.
</p><p>I think this process might leave us vulnerable in another way: if our urges to stay quiet come from
a sense of isolation, and we manage to stay quiet about that feeling, no one will sympathize with us.
We'll appear to be healthy, active participants in a conversation where we express ourselves.
Other people with a similar "process" for self-expression won't get a chance to empathize.
</p><p>(This is why I'm interested in putting together a Debian for Shy People caucus. I hope my Debconf proposal
for a Birds of a Feather session is accepted!)
</p><p><b>On finding a way out</b>
</p><p>We concluded on a happy note:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I haven't been answering Wikimedia mail for a while. Then I figured out that I don't have to use my real name, so I don't have to answer as someone with responsibility, I can just be some random volunteer. <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; Most of it is silly and trivial. But sometimes I am really able to address someone's concern or change someone's mind, and I forget how good that feels. <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; (There are some real jerks too.) <br />
&lt;mindspillage&gt; I got someone who was being snarky to apologize for being so rude. That was kind of awesome. Sometimes it doesn't take very much to make me happy.
</blockquote>
<p><b>P.S. A note from the archives</b>
</p><p>Apparently, for me,
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/working-vacation/tokyo-thursday.html">speaking French</a>
is exempt from the above restrictions.
