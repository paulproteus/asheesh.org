12-29-05 Blosxom Template version 1.0

My goal was to have a website that i could easily use the Gila template. The Gila template is originally from the OSWD website (http://www.oswd.org/) and was created by Haran (http://www.oswd.org/designs/search/designer/id/3013/). Haran does great work and out of respect you should leave something on the site that explains that he made the template originally. 

It was inspired by the old ActiveState perl website... which is sort of fitting.. seeing how blosxom is a perl script.

I took the template and made a rudimentary blosxom "Flavour" out of it. There are a couple things that i had to modify from the original, but it is very close. I only worked with the screen version and did nothing with the print verson. I did not make any changes to the .css files only the html.

I tried to comment in the html files where i made changes.. If you would like, you can leave the "blosxom flavour adapted by Mike Ferrari" link in the footer, that would be cool. You can link back to my template location (http://www.mikeferrari.com/downloads/) for the latest version.

To install:
1. Copy the .html and the .css files to your blosxom "data directory" or wherever you have set up in blosxom to put your "flavours".
2. Make sure your extension for flavours is correct (.html)
3. You will get an unformatted page when viewing, go in and modify the path that links to your .css file in the header to reflect the actual location of your .css file.
4. If you want to use the Blosxom Plugin: menu by Fletcher T. Penney, it is provided for you in this zip file, place the "menu" file in your plugins directory. If you dont want to use it, delete or rename the menu file and go into the header.html file and comment the existing left menu area and uncomment the original menu area and modify to your liking.

That should be about it.

If you have improvements or questions or comments you can email me. If you have improvements or changes you would like to see added, be sure to let me know.
