        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/stderred.html">Colorizing standard error: Adventures in LD_PRELOAD
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Kristian again asked an interesting question on the <a href="http://www.sf-lug.com/">SF-LUG</a> mailing list.
This time, it was: "<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/sf-lug/2008q3/005556.html">How can one get stderr and stdout to appear in different colors?</a>"  He was
asking on behalf of someone, in turn on behalf of a Java programmer.
</p><p>I thought about this and discussed it with Jesse Zbikowski, who I
happened to be sitting next to at the Tenderloin Computer Help Day
that Christian Einfeldt invited the list to (which turned out to be a
lot more interesting and orderly than I had imagined!).
</p><p>Jesse and I talked and we thought of named pipes, which Jesse got to work
on and produced a nice Perl tool for.  I thought about LD_PRELOAD and
got off to a few false starts, and finally came up with a tool
I called <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=zzz/colorize-stderr.git;a=summary">stderred</a> (<a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=zzz/colorize-stderr.git;a=snapshot;h=acab1846a3cff48a2e8d2bcbb77f2b5f10503ce4;sf=tgz">tarball of v1.2</a>).  It includes a demo program
in Java and a README.
</p>
<h2 id="w_ld-preload">LD_PRELOAD</h2>
<p>LD_PRELOAD wrappers are a way to change the way a program executes by
replacing library functions, like write() or gettimeofday(), with your
own homebrew versions.  You can think of the dynamic linker as
allowing you to stack your own things "above" the C library, but
"below" the actual program that runs.  So in looking for a symbol (a
function name, typically), the program searches down until it finds
it, and uses that.
</p><p>"stderred" is a C program and a Makefile that you can demonstrate
works properly; it includes a sample Java program and a README.
Because it intercepts the Java JRE's calls to write() to write out
messages to stdout, stderr, or whatever, and only modifies the ones to
stderr, it should be safe to use everywhere.  Plus there are no race
conditions; it runs right in the context of the program, so it also
avoids the performance penalty of context switches.
</p><p>This LD_PRELOAD wrapper is interesting, I think, because (thanks to
Eric Northup for the idea) it calls the real system write() function
by yanking it out of libc using dlopen()+dlsym().  I was also (you can
see this in the first few revisions) trying a #define hack to get
access to libc definitions without the real symbols; however, this
failed a link-time.  I don't see how it could work.
</p>
<h2 id="w_the-problem-with-named-pipes-buffering-can-change-the-order-of-outputted-lines">The problem with named pipes: Buffering can change the order of outputted lines</h2>
<p>Jesse pointed out to me that the named pipe approach has a serious
buffering issue related to timing: if the process writes to stderr and
stdout in quick succession, the lines could appear colorized in the
wrong order.  Jesse shows me some variations of his script that
changed which wrong order it generated, but we couldn't quite figure
out how to make it always right.  This seems like a race condition to
me.
</p><p>That's because when the named pipe in question is read from, the Perl
script doesn't know *how much* to read.  So in this case:
<pre>       one line to stderr
       one line to stdout
       one line to stderr
</pre>
<p>After Jesse explained this to me a few times, I understood it would get
printed as either:
<pre>       one line to stdout
       one line to stderr
       one line to stderr
</pre>
<p>or the same with stderr's lines on top.  Note that the interweaving is
gone; this is because the information of how *much* was printed each
time is thrown away by the OS.  Because the read()s are happening
out-of-process in both the ZSH and Perl ways to do this, I don't see
how they could get around this issue.  An implementation based on
select() or epoll() would have the same issues, I believe.
</p>
<h2 id="w_why-my-solution-doesnt-work-for-ls">Why my solution doesn't work for "ls"</h2>
<p>stderred is as simple as it is because it only overrides write().
The JRE only seems to use write(), not any of the helper functions like 
straight-up printf(), or error(), or fprintf(), that also write to file 
descriptors.  Unfortunately, if you try to stderred-ify "ls", none of   
stderr appears red!  That's because ls uses fprintf_unlocked() and      
error(), which themselves *inside libc* call write().
</p><p>If you think of ls as standing on top of a library stack that looks
like this:
<pre>       ls
       [stderred]
       [libc]
</pre>
<p>if you know that symbol resolution only looks "down," it's clear that
the functions *inside libc* don't go back *up* to stderred to find my
hacked write().  So they use the libc write(), which doesn't colorize.
</p><p>Therefore, I started down the long road of modifying "all the
important" functions to colorize if the output was going to stderr.
Trying to colorize "ls" is where I started, so I wrote quite a few of
those before actually checking what Java used.  "ls" <b>nearly</b> gets
colorized properly; you can look through the with_error branch for the
latest work down that path.  But I stopped once I figured out Java
seems okay with just write(), and for cleanliness's sake I left that
out of the released version (currently 1.1).  Patches welcome!
</p>
<h2 id="w_zsh-python-and-further-reading">zsh, python, and further reading</h2>
<p>According to the Gentoo-Wiki, zsh users have an <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/Zsh">easy way to enable colorizing stderr</a>.  Knowing little about zsh
but something about UNIX, it seems to me when they fork to run the new
program, they close() fd #2 (stderr) and open it as a pipe to this
program.  I don't see how they solve the races brought up by the Perl 
thing; it seems to me they'd have the same race.
</p><p>This is the same path that Jesse and I started down in the beginning; we
read http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html and noticed it  
didn't discuss setting stderr to a pipe, and then we talked about named
pipes....
</p><p>The Pythonic way to do this would have been to "simply" globally
override what <b>"sys.stderr"</b> is.  I don't know if such a thing is
possible in Java.
</p><p>You can read a quick tutorial on LD_PRELOAD in the IBM DeveloperWorks article,
"<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-glibc.html">Override the GNU C Library -- Painlessly</a>."  You
can read a lot more about dynamic linking in the exhaustive
"<a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/dsohowto.pdf">How To Write Shared Libraries</a>" by Ulrich Drepper.

       </h1>
		
<p> I have a habit of entering a community and leaving both an announce 
and a discuss list wherever I go.  The wisdom of this is still 
unresolved.  I thought I'd share one thing I do beyond that: set the reply-to header on the announce list to go to the discuss list.</p>

<p>That way, when there's an announcement and the peanut gallery wants 
to add something, they'll reply and the people interested in hearing 
more will hear it.</p>

<p>I remembered this upon reading that the <a 
href="http://balug.org">BALUG</a> lists have the same sort of split, and 
that in particular that they were considering (on an opt-out basis) <a 
href="http://lists.balug.org/pipermail/balug-admin-balug.org/2007-October/000419.html">auto-adding 
people from discuss to announce</a>.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/mailman-website-header.html">Adding a Website: header to Mailman messages</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>Very often, I like to quote mailing list messages to people not on 
those mailing lists.  Mailman is a common mailing list program, and 
Pipermail is commonly used for storing archives.  What ends up happening 
is that I fish around for the archive link and spend a minute or two 
figuring out which message it is.</p>

<p>So I wrote a short program to do that scraping for me.  You can check 
it out (literally, if you want, with svn) at <a 
href="http://svn.asheesh.org/svn/public/code/mail_tools/">the mail_tools 
directory</a> - look for add_mailman_website_header.py and 
sample_message.</p>

<p>Why the "Website:" header?  Thunderbird seems to show that by 
default, so that's one less configuration option I have to change.  (To 
match this, I changed my alpine config to show it too.)</p>

<p>You may also want to look at the procmailrc snippets I use to insert 
it into the mail processing pipeline.  Embarrassingly, configuring 
procmail to set it up took as long as writing this thing; it's been way 
too long....</p>

<pre>
## &lt;Mailman header addition>
:0 W
MAILMAN_URL=| python ~/svn/public/code/mail_tools/add_mailman_website_header.py go

:0 Waf
| formail -b -A "Website: $MAILMAN_URL"

## &lt;/Mailman>
</pre>

<p>One more thing: If you run it with 0 arguments, it does a 
self-unittest (which in a few days will give false negatives; maybe 
that'll encourage me to improve the program, but probably not!).  Hence 
I give it the meaningless argument "go".  It also waits for a 
configurable (45s by default) amount of time for the pipermail index to 
get updated, as in real-world tests it beat the pipermail index for the 
two list messages.</p>

around what appears to be a bug in the Python email module.  Report 
pending.  I'll post a screenshot in a day or two and call this project a
