       </h1>
		
<p>Kristian Hermansen sent an email to the San Francisco Linux Users 
Group list expressing <a 
href="http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/sf-lug/2007q4/002290.html">shock</a> 
at my "reverse smileys".  Others have, too, so let me take a moment to 
explain.<p>

<p>Some time around 1995, I started using AOL.  (I also stopped some 
time in the same century.)  I learned important vocabulary like "a/s/l" 
and "rofl" and PC Magazine sent me a free mousepad with Windows 95 
hotkeys like "Windows+R" for the Run dialog box.  Then our free month 
expired, and we went on to some other network.</p>

<p>Eventually I got into IM, and I started messaging friends routinely.  
I got into the habit of making complicated smileys - my favorite was Abe 
Lincoln: <tt> =|:-)=</tt> [<a 
href="http://www.eff.org/Net_culture/Folklore/Arts/smiley.list">source</a>]. 
And some time later on, the smileys started getting turned into 
pictures. It may have been cool that :-) turned into a picture of a <a 
href="http://tmbw.net/wiki/When_It_Rains_It_Snows">smiling yellow 
face</a>, but I found it offensive that (a) they (AOL) started doing 
this without asking me, on other people's computers, so I had no idea 
how my emoticon was going to be displayed, and (b) that they would 
totally corrupt smileys like Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>So I retaliated.  I came up with two counter-attacks.  The first was 
the smartest: :<em>-</em>) would not get graphicalized, I realized.  
(View the source if it's not clear how that works.)  That worked fine in 
media where I had rich formatting (HTML), but would fail me in emails.  
It was great for confusing my IMees, for whom it looked like a regular, 
old-school smiley, except all the other old-school smileys had gone away 
in favor of yellow circles with black lines and points.</p>

<p>The other way was more drastic and, instead of hiding between the 
lines, vocally made the point that not all smileys needed to be 
graphicalized.  That was to reverse the smiley.  I don't know when I 
started doing that, but it's probably some time between 1998 and 
2000.</p>

<p>I also liked to abuse smileys to make grinning asides in emails.  (-; 
You might wonder why asides needed to grin; usually they wink instead! 
;-)  I don't know if that idea came before or after I started making 
backwards smileys in the first place. I don't do this as much now in 
large part to me having seen Thunderbird turn my closing smileys into 
lame yellow things that ruin the symmetry.</p>

<p>One day during <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/">natural 
language processing</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Jason 
Eisner</a> said in class that he thought people who did the above thing 
(presumably without knowing I did it) were making an NLP joke.  That 
added to the feeling that NLP was right up my alley.</p>

<p>All in all, smileys have been a big part of my online life.  It's 
only fitting that the EFF and They Might Be Giants contributed to 
this post.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/sysop/future-without-ipv6.html">IPv6
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Kartik pointed me to 
<a href="http://jhw.vox.com/library/post/the-future-without-ipv6.html">this post</a> 
about "The Future without IPv6".  IPv6 is the future addressing scheme 
that the Internet will hopefully be transitioning to in the next decade 
or so; IPv4 is the current setup.  The reason we need a new addressing scheme
is simple - we've run out of addresses.  The dream of the Internet was
"end to end connectivity," but you can't do that if you don't have enough
addresses to give everyone on the network an address.
</p><p>You've seen this every time you open up a laptop and it gets an IP 
address from a "wireless router" - the IP address created for you by 
that router actually can't be reached from the broader Internet.  
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a trick the router plays where it 
changes the headers on your messages destined for the Internet so 
everyone else on the network thinks the box sent the message.  But this 
means if you want to do something not allowed by that box in the middle, 
or allowed but misunderstood, it is in an incontrovertible position to 
screw that up.
</p><p>The article writes:
</p>
<blockquote>Ubiquitous multilevel NAT means the Internet becomes a 
system for making TCP connections.</blockquote>
<p>Using the Internet only for TCP connections to me spells the end of 
decades of Internet innovations like Voice over IP that rely on the 
flexibility of the Internet.  And the fact that these connections must 
always go to the few servers able to have their own dedicated IP 
addresses creates a separate class of connection in the Internet world: 
"consumer" vs. "distributor".  That class distinction is what IP was 
designed to <i>erase</i>.
</p><p>I don't agree with the author that we will never move to IPv6, but I 
also know we won't do it fast enough to satisfy me.  Luckily, thanks to 
the "end to end" nature of the Internet, especially IPv6, I can do my 
own migration now and give my computers both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  
I'll be here in the future, waiting for the rest of you guys.
</p><p>P.S. I'm already "multiplexing multiple transports over a single TCP 
connection" with my always-on SSH tunnel.  I am aware of the drawbacks 
he lists.

		<p>CAPTCHAs are a name for programs designed to test if they are being
used by another computer (a "bot") or by a humamn.  They do this by
asking the user to do a task that presumably can't be done by a computer;
for example, reading obscured words.
</p><p><a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCAPTCHA</a> is a well-known CAPTCHA service that 
takes images from the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>'s book 
scanning project.  Some words are hard 
</p><p>But as for spam in MediaWiki, it seems that simply using the blacklists 
mentioned earlier is not enough; the Reed Free Culture wiki (for 
example) has been spammed beyond recognition with link spam.  So I am 
deploying reCAPTCHA to show a CAPTCHA to users when they register, and showing
a CAPTCHA to anonymous users who try to add links.
</p><p>P.S. Attentive people may consider a personal link I have to the
Internet Archive's book scanning project.  That has nothing to do
with my liking reCAPTCHA. (-:
