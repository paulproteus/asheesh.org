        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/as-cool-as-i-am.html">"As Cool As I Am"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I think this song is my favorite Dar Williams song.  You should really
<a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_Mortal_City_1_As_Cool_As_I_Am.mp3">give it a listen</a> and <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:As_Cool_As_I_Am">read the lyrics</a>.  So much for this being a daily serial!  But hopefully I'll get back on track for these last few days.
</p><p>The song begins with a forceful rhythm from what sounds like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>.
"Yeah, there was a time," the voice begins seamlessly.  We see her dating some, well, some jerk.  She
"was no sister then" - she did not stand up to support women in general.
</p>
<blockquote>
You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on <br />
Like you own them, just because you bought the time <br />
And you turn to me:
</blockquote>
<p>The music swells at "like you own them" and then stops.  Without a background, Dar emphasizes:
</p>
<blockquote>
You say you hope I'm not threatened.
</blockquote>
<p>"Bought the time"?  Maybe they are at a strip club.  But now they're at a 
more normal venue: "we're at a club":
</p>
<blockquote>
You watch the woman dancing--she is drunk, <br />
She is smiling, and she's falling in a slow descending funk.
</blockquote>
<p>Dar judges: "She is drunk."  She is smiling, but she is not really in control of herself.  At the end of the first verse,
Dar's date makes his point.  Like last time, his point is something worth rolling one's eyes at.  This time, Dar manages to respond:
</p>
<blockquote>
You play the artist, saying, "Is it how she moves, or how she looks?" <br />
I say, it's loneliness, suspended to our own like grappling hooks, <br />
And as long as she's got noise, she's fine.
</blockquote>
<p>We can see her judgment of the woman in her response here.  Her remark that the woman's loneliness is "suspended to our own [loneliness]" indicates that the judgement is not meant as harsh, as we are not to be spared.  Dar offers to help the woman learn to dance afterwards.  Is this sarcastic?  I think instead it is a sincere offer to teach something other than loneliness.  Dar exposes herself herself by attacking the pseudo-intellectual question asked by her date.
</p><p>The chorus changes slightly through the course of the song.  Throughout, she declares, "I will not be afraid of women."  Toward the start of the song,
we might imagine she means, "I am not afraid;" her utter lack of discomfort explains her not replying.  From the first chorus to the second, the first changes, emphasizing how she does not see the other women as people to compete against.
</p><p>She recognizes the self-doubt her partner has been trying to trick her into feeling.  Emotional trust comes from tenderness, sharing moments and feelings that aren't shown to everyone.  This closeness seems missing to her: "I thought you knew how to be scared."  Instead, our antagonist is always sure of himself, never risking his own feelings; rather, always risking Dar's.  In a declaration of strength:
</p>
<blockquote>
But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going, <br />
And so I'm leaving.
</blockquote>
<p>"You can find out how much better things can get," she sneers.  She is vulnerable: "I feel a little worse than I did when we met."  We don't know if this is because his tricks have worked a little or just because of the usual feelings of loss.  Dar sneaks in a breath just before, "And then I go outside to join the others."  I hear a smile, maybe half of a laugh at her own joke, in that "And."  She is "the others," because there is no one left beside this partner inside.
</p><p>"Oh, and that's not easy," is the final variant of the chorus lead.  At the end, "I will not be afraid of women" is a declaration that she has had enough of this (presumably) man trying to tickle her insecurity. What I love about this song is the combination Dar's expression of vulnerability and her ability to draw strength to take the risk of ending the abuse.  It's not just a tale of warning; it's an honest telling that heeding this warning may hurt.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/babysitters-here.html">"The Babysitter's Here"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>This song is on the first Dar Williams album, <i>The Honesty Room</i>, from 1993.  You can
<a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_The_Honesty_Room_5_The_Babysitter_s_Here.mp3">give it a listen</a>
and <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:The_Babysitter%27s_Here">read the lyrics</a>.
</p><p>The song is a gorgeous mix of violins and Dar doing her best to sound even cuter than usual.
Our narrator, the child, is happy, sweet, and naive.  You can see that as soon as the first verse:
</p>
<blockquote>
I don't understand and she tries to explain, <br />
How a spaceship is riding through somebody's brain, <br />
And there's blood and guts and... 
</blockquote>
<p>...and she trails off.  There's no point for our narrator to try to understand anything deeper;
it just doesn't work, so she talks about what makes her happy.  The babysitter!
</p>
<blockquote>
She's the best one we've ever had.
</blockquote>
<p>The chorus explains what makes her so great: she does things her own way.  "She sits on her hair!"
"She pierced her own ear!"  (Something which, upon reflection, probably hurt.)
At this point, who would not swoon?
"She's tall as my dad" - I suppose she never quite fit in that way.  But our narrator loves her for it.
</p><p>The violins swell as our babysitter is the <i>star</i>.  The narrator is adorable - overwhelmed!
"And she's oh! oh! oh!"
You can imagine her trembling with anticipation: "I can't wait to give her the card!" she repeats.
"She's the best one!" is all our narrator can say until she composes herself to explain
in the simplest logic.  Finally, she concludes:
</p>
<blockquote>
So that means that the star was... <br />
My babysitter.
</blockquote>
<p>Something's not right.  Tom is introduced by the narrator as "the king of romance," and she (the narrator) sighs,
"Someday I'll have a boyfriend just like that."  But if we look at his words:
</p>
<blockquote>
And will they get married with kids of their own? <br />
He says, "Not if she's going to college we won't."
</blockquote>
<p>This confinement of the babysitter is invisible to the innocent narrator, but not to the babysitter, and that conflict is 
what makes the song powerful.  Listening, I picked up on this and found sympathy for the babysitter especially because the 
narrator can't.  (I see a similar contrast between children's naivete and the pressures of adult decision in "The Kid's 
Song" by Moxy Fruvous.  But that song is co-narrated by adults and children; in this one, we don't see any direct voice of 
the grown-ups in conflict.  This story is told through the magical happy eyes of the child, making the babysitter's 
conflict look incomprehensible and unfair.)
</p><p>The actions of the babysitter with "the king of romance" make her seem voiceless.  There's the
above conversation, and:
</p>
<blockquote>
And she got mad at dinner when Tom drank a beer.
</blockquote>
<p>Tom's the one making choices here; all the babysitter can do is get angry, not alter Tom's behavior.
</p><p>I want to highlight a theme through Dar's work: The chorus changes to show a progression
of feeling.  The last line of this chrous is phrased three different ways in the three repetitions.  
The first time we see the babysitter, it is strictly joyful.
</p>
<blockquote>
And it's peace, man, cool, yeah, the babysitter's here...
</blockquote>
<p>After Tom drinks his beer, it seems to me Tom replies to her anger, trying to calm her down.  I especially
get that feeling from the "hey," as if it's short for, "Hey, don't act up in front of the kids you're babysitting,"
or "Stay cool, okay?".  It further squelches our poor babysitter's self-expression.
</p>
<blockquote>
But peace, man, cool, hey, the babysitter's here... 
</blockquote>
<p>Iit's only natural that the violins swell for our hero, the babysitter, when she shows herself as the beautiful and unique 
unicorn. She is choosing for herself, and the music celebrates appropriately.  In "As Cool As I Am," you saw men who put 
women in situations that strain their feelings.  Dar likes to see them turn out with agency for the woman, even at the 
cost of tears.
</p><p>So by the ending, our poor naive narrator misunderstands:
</p>
<blockquote>
I don't understand and she tries to explain, <br />
And all that mascara runs down in her pain, <br />
'Cause she's leaving me... 
</blockquote>
<p>The babysitter is leaving the narrator to go to college, having chosen it over Tom. "Don't go with a guy who would make 
you choose," she (the babysitter) warned.  Trying to explain, her eyes brimming, the babysitter struggles for sympathy 
from the narrator who won't understand the choice she had to make. So she points out she has to leave the narrator.
</p><p>In the final version of the chorus, the narrator tries to calm the babysitter.  Two or three words at a time, with pauses 
between, the narrator tries to soothe the girl with tears streaming.
</p>
<blockquote>
So hush now, <br />
peace, man, <br />
the babysitter's here. <br />
</blockquote>
<p>In "As Cool As I Am" and "The Babysitter's Here," I see self-driven girls making the right decision,
choosing themselves over their chauvinistic boyfriends.
When I chose today's song, it didn't occur to me how similar the songs were.  I think it shows
what I love about Dar Williams.
</p><p>On that note, I'll link to another song I like, this time with no explanation.  Enjoy
