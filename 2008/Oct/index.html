        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/packaging.html">Packaging, and other joys of Debconf
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I was trying to explain to my friend Emily (C.) some of the fun things about 
Debconf.
</p><p>On one of the first days I attended, I was standing around while
<a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/">some people I didn't yet know</a>
discussed piuparts, an automated Debian package tester.
</p><p>At this point when talking to Emily, I thought, Maybe I shouldn't bother 
explaining what piuparts is.  If I do explain it, it will make me much 
more interested in the telling of the story, as well as let her make 
sense of the story. Or I could be vague to avoid boring her, but then 
I'll bore myself by only teling the skeleton of a story.
</p><p>I know Emily well enough that she'll forgive me boring her, I decided.  
So I'll give it a try.
</p><p>"The bulk of work in Debian is packaging, which means finding up-to-date 
open source software and bundling it up into a nice installer," I began.
"Windows installers, if you're lucky, will create an entry in 
Add/Remove Programs.  But Debian installers, to comply with Debian 
Policy, have to do a lot more."
</p><p>"Let's say you already had the Safari web browser installed and you 
wanted to install Google Chrome, their new browser based on the same 
core as Safari. When you upgrade Safari, it would be nice if Google Chrome
also benefitted from the upgrade."
</p><p>"In Debian, it would."  I continued with another obscure fact about the 
Debian Policy.  "Another element of the Policy is that when a package is 
fully removed, it must leave no files and leave no programs running."
</p><p>Suddenly she was interested!  For a moment I didn't understand why.  Then I 
realized what I had said: Something I take for granted in Debian, the "leave
no trace" element, is something Windows users often wish they had.
</p><p>I continued, "There is an automated tool called piuparts which takes
packages, creates a small virtual install of Debian, run the package's
installer, the uninstalls it and verifies that the package does in fact leave no trace."
</p><p>Explaining the rest was easy: The first day I was at Debconf, I ran into 
some people discussing piuparts.  Lucas explained he was slow to program 
in Python, the language piuparts is written in, and Emily rightly picked 
up on the fact that Python is my favorite programming language.  Lucas 
explained that piuparts needed a machine-readable report format so that 
you could automatically run it on the whole Debian archive and get a 
list of which packages have problems.  I volunteered to add that.
</p><p>After a few days of hardly working on this, I finally was sitting with some 
new friends Thursday night.  They left, and I worked on everything I 
could possibly justify working on.  Then it was 5 a.m., and I knew there 
was no more time to waste if I wanted to actually finish the 
modification to piuparts.  So I began it, ate breakfast, and finished 
it.
</p><p>It was really great having a comfortable environment to work all night 
in.  It was even better that I had people to stay up late talking to 
about geeky things that came from a shared interest in programming, 
system administration, and Free Software principles.  When people left, 
there was always a great reason to stay awake: more great people to talk 
to, or finally the assignment I gave myself at the start of Debconf.  I 
had that joyous feeling from the people every evening at Debconf, and 
Thursday night the feeling brought me all the way to morning.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/if-i-wrote-you.html">"If I Wrote You"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>In the summer of 2000, a girl(friend) wrote me this in a letter
after we had nearly spent as long away from each other as we had known
each other (at least, known each other well):
</p>
<blockquote>
If I wrote you, <br />
You would know me, <br />
And you would not write me again.
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so "as long as we had known each other (well)" was about two 
weeks. She was quoting (and told me as much) "If I Wrote You," which you 
can <a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/03%20-%20Dar%20Williams%20-%20If%20I%20Wrote%20You.mp3">listen to</a> and whose 
<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:If_I_Wrote_You">lyrics you can read</a>.
</p><p>The song is an expression of fear.  That was clear from the bit of it I 
had received, so it took me by surprise. The conditional on "You would 
know me" hints that the recipient of the letter doesn't know the author 
well right now.
</p>
<blockquote>
So I started to write back about the trees and the snow, <br />
And I saw a bird, couldn't say what it was. <br />
But I thought you'd know, <br />
You always surprised me.
</blockquote>
<p>Right at the start, Dar does a perfect job of setting a scene outside my 
home window in upstate New York (Rochester).  As it happens, that's 
where Molly's letter was sent to find me, and where she would return 
after another week or two.  But right through the scenery we see a 
reflective, impressed letter writer, fearing that she is not worthy of 
the recipient's attention.
</p><p>After she got back, she would introduce me to Dar Williams, lending me
a few CDs here and there.  I have her to thank for a lot of things,
including tuning me into Dar.
</p><p>But in this song, it's interesting that Dar sings solo (sometimes 
harmonized against herself) except in every chorus, where a male voice 
joins her in harmony.  Instead of harmony, it sounds more like a distant 
voice whispering in her ear, the voice of someone now unreachable.
</p><p>The second verse, line by line, alternates the imagery of nature
with obscure but personal imagery.  It gives the song a sense of seriousness.
The flooding of the recipient's stories into the writer, and the idea that
the recipient knows this:
</p>
<blockquote>
The truth was the only way out, but not the only way
</blockquote>
<p>speaks to a sort of dark seriousness.  There is a way to get out of a mess,
but everyone knows that success is not the only choice.
</p><p>The third verse beings with a sense of irreverance:
</p>
<blockquote>
We drew our arms around the bastard sons, <br />
We never would drink to the chosen ones.
</blockquote>
<p>As the verse continues, I don't know how she left, or what she left.  
She's "steady now," but I don't know what sort of solace this gives her.
Musically, the feeling the song gives me is the same throughout: distant and sad.
The song is typical of Dar's work from the period: it sounds full,
and no shortage of words.  The song concludes with a sad certainty:
</p>
<blockquote>
You will not write me again.
</blockquote>
<p>If the conditional at the start, "You would not," indicates uncertainty, 
this last form indicates a sad finality.
</p><p>There's a theme in some of the other songs I've chosen, which is of 
women being strong to stand up to men who deserve it.  Here, we see 
quite the opposite.  The writer has certainty in love, unlike elsewhere 
where grating men destroy the protagonist's wonderful feelings.  The 
doubt comes from a respect for the love's target as it mixes dangerously 
with her own insecurity; it yields an empty, unsatisfied longing.
</p><p>So, hi.  I guess it's particularly fitting that I'm using this song in a 
Dar Williams A Day, since I haven't heard back from you.  But I've 
thought before that I wouldn't hear from you again, and I've been wrong 
about that before.
</p><p>So I look forward to you writing me again.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/as-cool-as-i-am.html">"As Cool As I Am"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I think this song is my favorite Dar Williams song.  You should really
<a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_Mortal_City_1_As_Cool_As_I_Am.mp3">give it a listen</a> and <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:As_Cool_As_I_Am">read the lyrics</a>.  So much for this being a daily serial!  But hopefully I'll get back on track for these last few days.
</p><p>The song begins with a forceful rhythm from what sounds like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>.
"Yeah, there was a time," the voice begins seamlessly.  We see her dating some, well, some jerk.  She
"was no sister then" - she did not stand up to support women in general.
</p>
<blockquote>
You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on <br />
Like you own them, just because you bought the time <br />
And you turn to me:
</blockquote>
<p>The music swells at "like you own them" and then stops.  Without a background, Dar emphasizes:
</p>
<blockquote>
You say you hope I'm not threatened.
</blockquote>
<p>"Bought the time"?  Maybe they are at a strip club.  But now they're at a 
more normal venue: "we're at a club":
</p>
<blockquote>
You watch the woman dancing--she is drunk, <br />
She is smiling, and she's falling in a slow descending funk.
</blockquote>
<p>Dar judges: "She is drunk."  She is smiling, but she is not really in control of herself.  At the end of the first verse,
Dar's date makes his point.  Like last time, his point is something worth rolling one's eyes at.  This time, Dar manages to respond:
</p>
<blockquote>
You play the artist, saying, "Is it how she moves, or how she looks?" <br />
I say, it's loneliness, suspended to our own like grappling hooks, <br />
And as long as she's got noise, she's fine.
</blockquote>
<p>We can see her judgment of the woman in her response here.  Her remark that the woman's loneliness is "suspended to our own [loneliness]" indicates that the judgement is not meant as harsh, as we are not to be spared.  Dar offers to help the woman learn to dance afterwards.  Is this sarcastic?  I think instead it is a sincere offer to teach something other than loneliness.  Dar exposes herself herself by attacking the pseudo-intellectual question asked by her date.
</p><p>The chorus changes slightly through the course of the song.  Throughout, she declares, "I will not be afraid of women."  Toward the start of the song,
we might imagine she means, "I am not afraid;" her utter lack of discomfort explains her not replying.  From the first chorus to the second, the first changes, emphasizing how she does not see the other women as people to compete against.
</p><p>She recognizes the self-doubt her partner has been trying to trick her into feeling.  Emotional trust comes from tenderness, sharing moments and feelings that aren't shown to everyone.  This closeness seems missing to her: "I thought you knew how to be scared."  Instead, our antagonist is always sure of himself, never risking his own feelings; rather, always risking Dar's.  In a declaration of strength:
</p>
<blockquote>
But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going, <br />
And so I'm leaving.
</blockquote>
<p>"You can find out how much better things can get," she sneers.  She is vulnerable: "I feel a little worse than I did when we met."  We don't know if this is because his tricks have worked a little or just because of the usual feelings of loss.  Dar sneaks in a breath just before, "And then I go outside to join the others."  I hear a smile, maybe half of a laugh at her own joke, in that "And."  She is "the others," because there is no one left beside this partner inside.
</p><p>"Oh, and that's not easy," is the final variant of the chorus lead.  At the end, "I will not be afraid of women" is a declaration that she has had enough of this (presumably) man trying to tickle her insecurity. What I love about this song is the combination Dar's expression of vulnerability and her ability to draw strength to take the risk of ending the abuse.  It's not just a tale of warning; it's an honest telling that heeding this warning may hurt.

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>This song is on the first Dar Williams album, <i>The Honesty Room</i>, from 1993.  You can
<a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_The_Honesty_Room_5_The_Babysitter_s_Here.mp3">give it a listen</a>
and <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:The_Babysitter%27s_Here">read the lyrics</a>.
</p><p>The song is a gorgeous mix of violins and Dar doing her best to sound even cuter than usual.
Our narrator, the child, is happy, sweet, and naive.  You can see that as soon as the first verse:
</p>
<blockquote>
I don't understand and she tries to explain, <br />
How a spaceship is riding through somebody's brain, <br />
And there's blood and guts and... 
</blockquote>
<p>...and she trails off.  There's no point for our narrator to try to understand anything deeper;
it just doesn't work, so she talks about what makes her happy.  The babysitter!
</p>
<blockquote>
She's the best one we've ever had.
</blockquote>
<p>The chorus explains what makes her so great: she does things her own way.  "She sits on her hair!"
"She pierced her own ear!"  (Something which, upon reflection, probably hurt.)
At this point, who would not swoon?
"She's tall as my dad" - I suppose she never quite fit in that way.  But our narrator loves her for it.
</p><p>The violins swell as our babysitter is the <i>star</i>.  The narrator is adorable - overwhelmed!
"And she's oh! oh! oh!"
You can imagine her trembling with anticipation: "I can't wait to give her the card!" she repeats.
"She's the best one!" is all our narrator can say until she composes herself to explain
in the simplest logic.  Finally, she concludes:
</p>
<blockquote>
So that means that the star was... <br />
My babysitter.
</blockquote>
<p>Something's not right.  Tom is introduced by the narrator as "the king of romance," and she (the narrator) sighs,
"Someday I'll have a boyfriend just like that."  But if we look at his words:
</p>
<blockquote>
And will they get married with kids of their own? <br />
He says, "Not if she's going to college we won't."
</blockquote>
<p>This confinement of the babysitter is invisible to the innocent narrator, but not to the babysitter, and that conflict is 
what makes the song powerful.  Listening, I picked up on this and found sympathy for the babysitter especially because the 
narrator can't.  (I see a similar contrast between children's naivete and the pressures of adult decision in "The Kid's 
Song" by Moxy Fruvous.  But that song is co-narrated by adults and children; in this one, we don't see any direct voice of 
the grown-ups in conflict.  This story is told through the magical happy eyes of the child, making the babysitter's 
conflict look incomprehensible and unfair.)
</p><p>The actions of the babysitter with "the king of romance" make her seem voiceless.  There's the
above conversation, and:
</p>
<blockquote>
And she got mad at dinner when Tom drank a beer.
</blockquote>
<p>Tom's the one making choices here; all the babysitter can do is get angry, not alter Tom's behavior.
</p><p>I want to highlight a theme through Dar's work: The chorus changes to show a progression
of feeling.  The last line of this chrous is phrased three different ways in the three repetitions.  
The first time we see the babysitter, it is strictly joyful.
</p>
<blockquote>
And it's peace, man, cool, yeah, the babysitter's here...
</blockquote>
<p>After Tom drinks his beer, it seems to me Tom replies to her anger, trying to calm her down.  I especially
get that feeling from the "hey," as if it's short for, "Hey, don't act up in front of the kids you're babysitting,"
or "Stay cool, okay?".  It further squelches our poor babysitter's self-expression.
</p>
<blockquote>
But peace, man, cool, hey, the babysitter's here... 
</blockquote>
<p>Iit's only natural that the violins swell for our hero, the babysitter, when she shows herself as the beautiful and unique 
unicorn. She is choosing for herself, and the music celebrates appropriately.  In "As Cool As I Am," you saw men who put 
women in situations that strain their feelings.  Dar likes to see them turn out with agency for the woman, even at the 
cost of tears.
</p><p>So by the ending, our poor naive narrator misunderstands:
</p>
<blockquote>
I don't understand and she tries to explain, <br />
And all that mascara runs down in her pain, <br />
'Cause she's leaving me... 
</blockquote>
<p>The babysitter is leaving the narrator to go to college, having chosen it over Tom. "Don't go with a guy who would make 
you choose," she (the babysitter) warned.  Trying to explain, her eyes brimming, the babysitter struggles for sympathy 
from the narrator who won't understand the choice she had to make. So she points out she has to leave the narrator.
</p><p>In the final version of the chorus, the narrator tries to calm the babysitter.  Two or three words at a time, with pauses 
between, the narrator tries to soothe the girl with tears streaming.
</p>
<blockquote>
So hush now, <br />
peace, man, <br />
the babysitter's here. <br />
</blockquote>
<p>In "As Cool As I Am" and "The Babysitter's Here," I see self-driven girls making the right decision,
choosing themselves over their chauvinistic boyfriends.
When I chose today's song, it didn't occur to me how similar the songs were.  I think it shows
what I love about Dar Williams.
</p><p>On that note, I'll link to another song I like, this time with no explanation.  Enjoy

       </h1>
		<p>I had an old project that never quite succeeded to mine Wikipedia for style edits — 
through this, one could learn what made a style improvement, and attempt to generalize 
that to other texts.  Think of it as the minimal boostrapping of a purely-statistical 
"grammar checker."  It was originally to be my masters project under the awesome
<a href="http://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Jason Eisner</a>.  (Instead, I contributed to a storage
layer branch of <a href="http://www.dyna.org/">Dyna</a>'s compiler.)
</p><p>It has some nice filters (written using SAX, so they don't chew up all your RAM for 
pages with 2GB of history) for filtering down MediaWiki page dumps into just what we 
want, also optionally modifying their text so that the new outputted versions contain 
the results of data processing.
</p><p>The code also has some hilarious (and useful!) Makefiles that treat a bunch of 
heterogenous computers as a compute cluster.  The higher "-j" you pass into make, the 
more machines it will SSH into, copy your code onto, run your code, and rescue the 
output.
</p><p>I'm putting in my git repository having dug it out of my JHU NLP Subversion 
repository.  Check it out in <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=zzz/wikipedia-style-edits.git">my gitweb</a>.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/worlds-not-falling-apart.html">"The World's Not Falling Apart"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>The album begins with the gentle, creeping synth of "Mercy of the Fallen" that grows into bass guitar flourishes and rhythmic confidence atypical for Dar Williams.  All over, this album is decorated with special guests.  It's a great way to start an album, that's for sure.
</p><p>The album is <i>The Beauty of the Rain</i> from 2003, a much sadder-sounding title than that opening track.  Don't worry; the song that shares that title is deservedly slow and pensive (and beautiful).  If you look through a <a href="http://darwilliams.net/discography.html">Dar Williams discography</a>, you'll learn a few things: I only have half her albums, and also that this album is a reappearance of Dar after a three-year hiatus from studio publications.
</p><p>Recoveries like that are interesting; one can learn a lot about oneself in three years.  It's a cliché to suggest live albums (like <i>Out There Live</i> (2001)) represent a pause in the creative career of a musician; more interesting is the question of what Dar would see after three years of looking back and recreating her earlier work.
</p><p>So when I say the album begins with gentle, creeping synth, and that it's "atypical," it really is the new Dar Williams.  It's no wonder that the second track is titled "Farewell To The Old Me."  I'm really happy to say that I love this album, and I'll point you to track five on it: "The World's Not Falling Apart", to which you can <a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_The_Beauty_Of_The_Rain_5_World_s_Not_Falling_Apart_Feat_Stefan_Lessard_and_Michael_Kang.mp3">listen</a> or <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:The_World%27s_Not_Falling_Apart">read the lyrics</a>.
</p><p>Truth be told, I think I like the sound of first song on this album more, so I'll <a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_The_Beauty_Of_The_Rain_1_Mercy_Of_The_Fallen.mp3">slip it in here</a>.  Musically speaking, the harmonies in its chorus and the instrumentation are irresistible.  But I chose "Not Falling Apart" because for the year 2005-2006, this song was very helpful for me.  Putting that first song together with this fifth makes for a powerful combination.
</p><p>There's a contrast to be considered between the sudden recognition of responsibility in "Buzzer" and a song with a title like this one's.  To be brief, the song (you should have listened to it by now!) is about acceptance.  Take this couplet, delivered without fear:
</p>
<blockquote>
The closest thing to God that I have heard <br />
Is when I knew I did not have the final word
</blockquote>
<p>The year I mentioned was my senior year of college as well as the year I stopped being a teenager.  "It's not an end, it's just a start," I could have consoled myself.
</p><p>But the scene that really wins me over is a verse I can't resist quoting in full:
</p>
<blockquote>
I have watched the kids who make their scenes, <br />
I have met the riot grrls who print their 'zines. <br />
They write the word, they raise a thought. <br />
They say who they are, they try what they’re not, <br />
'Cause life is such a changing art, life is such a changing art.
</blockquote>
<p>I must give justice to Dar and highlight the beautiful singing all across this song; it's wonderful when she supports the chorus, but for me it's prettiest when she sings the above verse.  I used to hear that "they race apart," which I'm consoled to see isn't what she sings.
</p><p>"They try what they're not" happens to strike a chord in me.  It's reassuring to imagine having this certainty in who they are while they see what else they could be.  "Life is such a changing art."  I struggle with the interplay between causing those changes oneself and the idea that I have some consistent identity.  Typically I feel lost and doubtful for a few months, trying new events and people and situations, and I wonder why nothing feels all that great.  Then something happens that reminds me of things and people I truly love. The crux of it is that I forget how much I love some things, and the process of searching becomes mired with an inability to say which new thing is better than the other. These wonderful things appear, and as if I feel frayed or rubbed thin, they feel restorative.
</p><p>Every once in a while those wonderful things are new places or interactions with new people, and then I am really grateful in this life.  (Like you.)
</p><p>There surely are people that are pulling the world apart.  Dar Williams knows that she is respectful and playful.  Even if she can't save everyone's everything everywhere, she espouses awareness and acceptance.  I think she's highlighting something I believe in, too: do better, first, and only later try to be perfect.  I've long believed in that, but I haven't always lived it.  She can take solace in her relative and absolute goodness, even if it has limits.
</p><p>There are a couple of lines I don't really like: the third of the first verse, and the last of the last one.  But I'll take them.
</p><p>The new Dar Williams sound does seem to have longer, fluffier songs.  It's also less <a href="http://makesad.us/">sad</a>.  Perhaps the special guests are here to help Dar regain confidence.  At more than four minutes long, "The World's Not Falling Apart" is not afraid to lean on its chorus.  "And that's okay."

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/buzzer.html">"Buzzer"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>"Buzzer" is my favorite song on the new album, <cite>Promised Land</cite>.  You can <a href="http://paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dwad/Dar_Williams_Promised_Land_5_Buzzer.mp3">give it a listen</a> as you <a href="http://www.elyricsworld.com/buzzer_lyrics_dar_williams.html">read the lyrics</a>.
</p><p>(When searching for lyrics for it, I ran into a site with this ad: "How do you know if this pill goes with that pill?"  My sentiments exactly.)
</p><p>The song starts with percussion and a tapping beat that continues up until the first mention of the buzzer.  You'll hear it through all the verses.  During the verses, there are two notes between which she alternates to create a feeling of dissonance.  If you compare this song to yesterday's, you'll feel the song is less "full" - there are fewer different frequencies being sent to you.  The chorus serves to resolve a lot of this musically, smoothing these things out in two parts: "I would press the buzzer" removes the tapping beat, and the image of driving home adds some much-needed change across the board.
</p><p>Dar's website explains that the song is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">the famous social psychology experiment(s)</a> by Stanley Milgram.  Milgram <a href="http://home.swbell.net/revscat/perilsOfObedience.html">summarizes them</a>, "The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation."
</p><p>Dar <a href="http://www.darwilliams.com/index.php?page=about">calls it</a>, "A subject I have been obsessed with since reading about it when I was 18."
</p><p>We start with a scene of self-contented loneliness, even detachment from a relationship with the outside world.  She can have "anything I want" "cheaper than the stuff I make myself."  We see her go through the Milgram experiment, something I won't repeat because it stands on its own. The process concludes, "Here's your seventy bucks, now everything's changed."  She asks us to consider the everyday cruelty we could contribute to; as the buzzer masked her character from feeling responsible for it, so might things like the market shield her in her current life of shoes and stocks.
</p><p>I've complained to my friend Jonathan about social psychology experiments, in particular harping on the idea that these aren't "experiments."  (As far as I know, there's no control group to see if people would push the buzzer without the force of authority.)  The way I put it to him was, "Breaking news: people aren't rational!"  Growing up in the 1990s, that somehow seemed pretty evident to me (and of course I include myself in that list of irrational people).  The value of these social psychology experiments, "just like a game," is in highlighting that fact and by drawing attention to <i>specific</i> manifestations of our non-rational decision processes.
</p><p>Like last time, in this song Dar learns something about herself.  That's probably also something you'll see in the songs I like of hers; on the hand, it may be true of most of her songs.  There a simplicity in this song compared to her earlier work.  Last time, when there were hidden words of support: "Good, okay," here there seems to be nothing beneath the surface.  You could see this as emblematic of a change in Dar's work, something like changing from a world-gazing, secret-keeping child into a grown-up with concerns and interests.
</p><p>That's alright, it's okay.
</p><p>P.S. I know I've been remiss on the scheduling.  I'll work on that.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/dwad/what-do-you-hear-in-these-sounds.html">"What Do You Hear In These Sounds?"
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>This song is on the first Dar Williams album I owned, <cite>The End of The Summer</cite> (1997).  You can <a href="http://endof:thetour@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/dmad/04%20-%20Dar%20Williams%20-%20What%20Do%20You%20Hear%20In%20These%20Sounds.mp3">listen to the song</a> or <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Dar_Williams:What_Do_You_Hear_In_These_Sounds">read the lyrics</a>; I suggest you do both!
</p><p>The chorus (and title) is a question asked by a therapist to the main character, who (as a rule in my listening to Dar Williams) I imagine to be Dar herself.  The music starts with intensity and rhythm (read: certainty) that it maintains throughout.  It supports, through contrast, the uncertain protagonist.  The song begins with rhymes like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
And we fathom all the mysteries, explicit and inherent; <br />
When I hit a rut, she says to try the other parent.
</blockquote>
<p>I like the combination of Latin-derived words in the first line with a throwaway line about stereotypes of therapy.  Of the therapist herself, we're told:
</p>
<blockquote>
And she wants to tell me something, <br />
but she knows that it's much better if I get for myself.  
</blockquote>
<p>"Myself" has a twinge of cuteness that appears in what is mostly a serious song.  You'll hear it again toward the end in how she says she would be "scared."
</p><p>I heard this song at a time in my life when I was wondering about therapy.  Dar begins with a half-apology:
</p>
<blockquote>
I don't go to therapy to find out if I'm a freak,
</blockquote>
<p>but that's not what bothered me about it.  Therapy struck me as just another friend, but for pay.  We urban folk who claim to need this stuff are all pretty similar, and if so many of us need to pay for friends, it struck me as indicative of a general problem. Doesn't the presence of this mean that probably I need it too?
</p><p>That bothered me.  I'd rather believe I, and everyone else, can solve our respective problems by just talking to people normally.  I suppose on reflection I certainly do believe there are exceptional circumstances and exceptional helpers.  At first, she doesn't seem to be taking it seriously.  Like a teenager testing if a parent is listening, she rambles on.  We get this little argument between the therapist and Dar:
</p>
<blockquote>
And she says "Oh." I say, "What?" she says, "Exactly,"
</blockquote>
<p>Decisively, in three words punctuated by a voiceless stop, we see the therapist insisting Dar understand her own life.
</p>
<blockquote>
She says, "Look"
</blockquote>
<p>After this verse, after its chorus, we hear Dar's melodic voice sing a line of ahs, but underneath we overhear one side of a soft-spoken conversation.  To me parts sounds like:
</p>
<ul><li> Good, try again.
</li><li> Try to remember.
</li><li> Go back, try again.
</li><li> Good, okay.
</li></ul>
<p>(I'd love help deciphering the rest of the rest of these.  Now that I've heard them, I can't focus on the ahs anymore.)
</p><p>As I turned from a teenager to twenty, I remember saying to myself, twisting a line from this song:
</p>
<blockquote>
But oh how I loved everybody else, <br />
When I finally had so little to say about myself!
</blockquote>
<p>"What do you hear in these sounds?" is a question about what she hears in all her talking at these therapy sessions.  Eventually, she comes to respect the events of her own life, even if they're "stories that nobody hears."  Her mood changes in the last verse changes from self-doubt to realizing that everyone else has the same worries, "just like me."  In this verse, she thinks about herself as she "wake[s] up" — the revelation came not at therapy, on schedule, but one morning by herself.
</p><p>This transition from concerned, perhaps painfully self-aware, to consoled and confident is typical of my favorite Dar Williams songs.   As she concludes half a minute before the end of the song, "That's what I hear in these sounds," pay attention to her carefree rendition of that last word.  A line of oohs rise to support her, and until the end we hear a chorus of harmonies.

</p><p>Unfortunately, the IP addresses it assigns for virtualization happen to be in the 
same subnet as my desktop at work (at CC, 10.0.2.x).  I had some fear of
changing a piece of software as presumably complex as qemu.
</p><p>I forged ahead and came up with a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg15809.html">patch that I posted to the qemu-devel mailing list</a>.
I'm just wring this post in case someone wonders, "How can I change the IP
address of the user net layer used by qemu to avoid a conflict?"
</p><p>The answer is as easy as replacing the string "10.0.2" with "10.0.3" globally
across the qemu codebase and recompiling.  If that mailing list post ever goes away,
I have a <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/qemu-patch/qemu-10.0.3.x.2008-10-05.patch">local copy of the patch</a>.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/sysop/vhost_effort.html">What are your most expensive websites to run?  Patching Apache to find out
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>When running a busy webserver, one may want to know how much
<b>server</b> time is spent preparing each request.  That would be
especially useful if broken-down per web site you host.  Server
processing time indicates things like how long MySQL queries took, or
how loaded the disks are; in general, they are the measure of how difficult
it was to answer a request.  It may also be interesting to compare
server time spent processing a request today to the same request's time
in the past as an indication of how system changes (upgraded disks, more
complex filesystem) have affected your ability to process web requests.
</p><p>Apache's <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a> lets you log how long a request takes from 
start to end, which includes the amount of time taken to send the actual data.  That can be imagined as server_processing_time +
time_to_send_data_to_client.  I wasn't interested in seeing how slow or fast clients' net connections were.
</p><p>In a project I named vhost_effort, I wrote a patch to Apache to be able 
to log just that server time spent from the start of the request to when 
the request is ready to be sent.  That work was done at Creative 
Commons, and the software results are available under the Apache 2.0 
license.  vhost_effort.py is a hack that generates a pie graph for how 
much server time is spent on each vhost (among other sorts of 
visualizable statistics).  I began thinking of using a visualizer
for disk usage to make the pie graph interactive, but by the time
I was nearly done working that out we had already gathered all
the data we needed.
</p><p>My <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/projects/">projects page</a> has a link to the
code in the Creative Commons Subversion repository.  I did 
<a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2007/08/13/a-patchy-web-server/">write about this at labs.creativecommons.org</a> a year ago also.
