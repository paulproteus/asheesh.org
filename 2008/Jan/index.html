<a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/baypiggies/2008-January/002860.html">had to write a simple GUI program on a deadline</a>, so I thought I

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>As I got on the BART to ride back home from Oakland today, I felt 
something that I'd heard about but had never felt before:
</p>
<blockquote>I need a drink.</blockquote>
<p>I thought for another minute, and dreamed of a tall glass of some tasty 
cider.  I felt extremely worn, and had just had what felt like a failed 
conversation after a meeting that, itself, left me feeling tired.
</p><p>I've chosen to drink [alcoholic drinks] before, but never felt like 
using drinking as a tool to fix something that felt wrong.  I've chosen 
to drink when I've felt tired, but those times (that time?) I didn't 
also feel unhappy at the time - just tired.
</p><p>I remembered that only a couple of years ago the fact that drinking 
would change my mood was a scary thought, and in a moment realized, 
"This feeling right now now - this is what I was afraid of."  I didn't 
feel afraid of it or even apprehensive about it while it was happening, 
though.  "I guess I'll find a nice cider on the way home," I decided, my 
inner teenage voice notwithstanding.
</p><p>Brain-fried, I sat through a BART ride that started with me going the 
wrong way.  I got to my destination station, and there I found a water 
fountain.  After only a few sips of water, I suddenly felt much less 
tired.  Certainly enough that I no longer felt the "need" to drink 
anymore.
</p><p>I didn't quite feel happy, though.  But then I passed a cute girl on the 
walk home from BART; and she passed me, joined her two friends, and said 
to one, "How do you make that sound like a spray paint can?"
</p><p>Then I heard what felt like the most joyfully whimsical sound in the 
world.  I'm chuckling now thinking of it, and I laughed then.  The girl 
in turn was pleased, and I heard her say as much.
</p><p>After all that, I looked up at the sky and said, Thanks.

		<p>I exclaimed to Lisa when I signed my contract to start working, 
"Someone's going to hand me thousands of votes every month!"
</p><p>I try to treat these dollars with respect.  So far, I haven't given any 
of them to the MPAA as part of watching movies in theaters or buying 
movies.  (I haven't participated in free advertising for them either by 
watching their movies for free without their permission.)  I've bought 
music from eMusic.com or directly from the artist in the case of 
Girlyman.
</p><p>It's easy to watch when I hand dollars to the copyright industry.  But 
what to do about socks and shoes?  Where can I go to buy shoes that 
weren't made in sweatshops?
</p><p>Enter the <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/index.php">Blackspot sneaker</a>
brand.  It's by the people from <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/home/">Adbusters</a>.
</p><p>They tell me the shoes are 
<a href="http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php">made in a union shop in Portugal</a> 
from organic hemp.  I don't (yet?) feel like I 
need everything I own to be made of hemp, but the organic bit is a nice 
touch.  I can <a href="http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/retail/index.php">buy them</a> practically next door,
at <a href="http://www.delasole.com/">De La Sole Footwear</a> in the Castro.
</p><p>More on socks another time.
</p><p>P.S. Thanks <a href="http://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/2005/05/09/sweat-free-shoes-yes-you-can/">Jim at Irregular Times</a> for the link (via Cthuugle).

		<h3 id="w_what-went-well-in-2007">What went well in 2007</h3>
<ul><li> I have a job working to advance a cause I believe in.
</li><li> I have a fairly nice server being treated to love and pampering.
</li><li> I'm living in a nice slice of a house with an awesome roommate.
</li><li> I've settled on some asheesh.org tech that I seem to be interested in actually using.
</li><li> Since taking over the tech for Students for Free Culture, I've been fairly responsible and reliable.  (Certainly when compared to our previous experiences.)
</li><li> I (still) have good friends.
</li><li> I seem to have adequate social skills.
</li><li> I've been consistently uploading packages (through a sponsor) to the Debian archive, and I now have Debian Maintainer status.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_what-went-poorly">What went poorly</h3>
<ul><li> I still am not using a phone running only Free Software for everyday use.
</li><li> The asheesh.org tech is quite barebones - no comments, no photos, no artificially-creative automatic free-association.
</li><li> I'm still only "nearly" using full-text search on IMAP.
</li><li> I lost freaking gobs of data in a massive disk crash.
</li><li> I still don't have quick automatic easy access to all the songs I own.
</li><li> My computers still don't do everything I want them to in the blink of an eye without me even asking, and all my computers aren't connected to each other with wireless gigabit links.
</li><li> I'm still afraid of voicemail and of calling some people.
</li><li> My bedroom has been a disaster zone.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_what-i-didnt-guess-would-happen">What I didn't guess would happen</h3>
<ul><li> Gaurav seems to be using Ubuntu and enjoying Compiz Fusion.
</li><li> Apple launched DRM-free music on their iTunes store.
</li><li> I ran into #joiitoers at least twice by accident.
</li><li> I went to Burning Man, and learned that I think I prefer the Mystery Hunt.
</li><li> I sat on a terrace in Croatia and drank Absynthe (I know, the boring legal-in-Germany kind).
</li><li> I went to Tokyo to present about the Semantic Web (and Neurocommons) to a room full of people twice my age.  While in town, I struck up a conversation in French with some Swiss dudes.
</li><li> I looked at myself in a mirror on two separate occasions, and realized that getting a haircut looked <b>really</b> good, and also that torn sneakers look like someone sticking his tongue out.
</li></ul>
<p>I wonder what 2008 will be like.
