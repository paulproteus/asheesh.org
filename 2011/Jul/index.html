        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/working-vacation/debconf-2011.html">A day in the life of me, at Debconf
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>On Tuesday, July 26, I was in Banja Luka, Bosnia.
</p><p>I am here for Debconf 2011, this year's meetup of contributors and enthusiasts
of Debian. I am a developer in Debian.
</p><p><img src="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2011/05/debconf11_and_you/debconf11-goingto.png" height="120" width="120" />
</p><p>In the morning, I wake up late still feeling a bit of the effect of the
<a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf11/CheeseWineBoF">Wine and Cheese birds-of-a-feather session</a>.
</p><p>I manage to make it to the <a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/701.en.html">talk by the Debian System Administration team</a>.
I chatted with <a href="http://fifthhorseman.net/">dkg</a>. We both decide to take naps.
</p><p>I wake up at about 2:45 PM, at which time I realized I had missed lunch. I had been hoping to be at
lots of talks during Tuesday, but things aren't working out well for that. Having
missed both lunch and breakfast, food seems important enough to delay my walk
to <a href="http://www.cyberbulevar.com/banjaluka/kultura/dom-kulture--kulturni-centar-banski-dvor/20050111/">Banski Dvor, the conference venue</a>.
</p><p>I walk around the venue. I have exactly 1.30 KM (Bosnian currency) in my pocket
and no ability to understand the Bosnian language. I find an ice cream stand on a street corner
that is generally packed with and surrounded by commerce of that kind. It looks more like a
gelato stand than an "ice cream" stand.
</p><p>I wait in a confusing non-line, and finally am at the front. I ask if the young lady behind the counter
speaks English; she doesn't. I put my 1.30 on the counter and ask, "How many scoops?" She mulls over the
question, and raises two fingers.
</p><p>I point to strawberry and chocolate-hazelnut-with-pieces-of-hazelnut. She gives me a cone with two scoops
of delicious, although not shocking, ice cream. The strawberry pieces are sort of oddly crunchy due to
being frozen. The hazelnut chunks are the highlight of the purchase. I eat this and walk toward the venue.
I stand at the front door of the venue, finishing my ice cream because food is not allowed indoors. As I
eat the bottom of the cone, I marvel
at the spherical shape of the scoop of hazelnut-chocolate ice cream.
</p><p>I attend most of a BoF (birds of a feather session) on the interest Debian has in
<a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/784.en.html">tracking how people are using our websites</a>.
We mostly all agree that knowing more about what people do on debian.org would be nice. During the BoF,
I also handle IMs about some bills that have to be paid in our house.
</p><p>At the <a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/725.en.html">publicity BoF</a>, I learn that
the Publicity team in Debian is doing a particularly good job, but is having trouble growing. During that
time, the housemate and I come to a good set of conclusions about how to best proceed. I am pleased that
we successfully identified current and future processes that avoid this problem in the future and also
retain a great deal of clarity for the other people who didn't plan the process.
</p><p>We talk about the booths that Debian runs at various conferences and meetings during
the <a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/731.en.html">Events BoF</a>. I learn that I am not
the only booth staffer who has stood in <i>front</i> of the booth, making it hard to tell the booth <i>staff</i>
from the visitors.
</p><p>At 7 PM, we all go outside for the group photo. I missed the group photo in New York in 2010.
The group photo from <a href="https://gallery.debconf.org/v/debconf8/karora/OfficialPhoto.jpg.html">2008</a>
shows how much fun I was having (lots). I remember (possibly mis-remember) having used it, the summer of 2009, in a presentation to prospective
funders of OpenHatch.
</p><p>So I take special care to not miss the group photo. I am standing next to Jonas Smedegaard. He maintains
the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/uw-imapd">UW IMAPd package</a>; it shares a lot of code with the package
I most actively maintain, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/alpine">alpine</a>.
</p><p>When I find him and walk toward him, Jonas says to me, "You know, it's very important who you are standing
next to in the group photo!"
</p><p>I replied, "Yes -- I had better get away from you, then!" He doesn't understand the joke; I explain it.
</p><p>Then we see Aigars standing on the balcony facing us, moving his camera around as he took a few photos of us.
We all laugh a lot as he waited while a flag blew in front of his camera. blocking his view of us.
</p><p>He tells us, "Everybody say: <i>squeeze</i>!"
</p><p>The 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/5979331357/lightbox/">result</a>
is fantastic. Herbert even looks great. As we walk toward dinner (across the street), I think
imagine he will stitch the photos together with <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>.
</p><p>Dinner that evening, as with the other evenings, was sponsored; it was at the hotel restaurant. A mix-up
involving different types of meal tickets means that I wait in line twice. After the small wait, I eat
and chatted with Niels, where I learn about an important (and amusing) but in lintian. Then
I go to the hacklab
and work on <a href="http://expo.debian.net/">Debexpo</a>, a web app that Debian has been trying to build for three years.
I appointed myself the task of finishing that about a year ago. I thought Debconf would be a
good time to finish doing that; in an email that evening, I indicate that I was not going to work on it much more after
Debconf.
</p><p>That evening, I don't take part in the <a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/day_2011-07-26.en.html">PGP keysigning</a>.
I stay in the hacklab and mostly work on Debexpo.
</p><p>After one particularly frustrating issue involving my lack of knowledge of PostgreSQL and the disappointing
fact that I have to retain users' data rather than just drop the database,
I pop upstairs for a short game of Mao. I am late, as I expected, but I am eager to learn the rules
by playing. However, within about ten minutes, one player was argues with another
(Joachim) about a rule. Joachim had created the rule; the dealer simply asked Joachim, "Are you correct?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered Joachim. "I'm quite sure I am applying the rule consistently."
</p><p>This satisfies Ian Jackson, the dealer. It isn't enough for the arguer.
Ian looked increasingly upset as this circular discussion continues
for about thirty seconds. Finally, sharply, Ian tells us the cards were his, and
this is no way to play, and that he is going to do something else!
Without any argument, the cards return to him.
</p><p>As we pack up the chairs and move the table back to where it belongs, Ian asked me, "Was that the
right thing to do?"
</p><p>I pause for a moment. I wouldn't have done what he did, but I am impressed by the self-actualization and 
clarity of his action. "One of a few possible right things," I answer with conviction.
</p><p>Ian is someone I had met the night before. It was after the cheese and wine BoF had ended. I vaguely
remember somehow still having a drink in my hands. I could be mistaken.

<p>On <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2011/schedule#day_2011_06_24">Friday, June 24</a>, the last day of <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2011/schedule">Open Source Bridge</a>, I won a scarf! It says, "Open Source Citizen."</p>

<p>I wasn't the only one. The attendees nominated people who "<a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/blog/2011/06/wrapping-up-2011/">made an extra effort to help others and share their knowledge</a>," and the conference committee chose the three people they felt exemplified this. The winners were <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana Harihareswara</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/igalko">Igal Koshevoy</a>, and me.</p>

<p>In case you don't know Sumana, she's the new Wikimedia <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Staff">Volunteer Development Coordinator</a>, a friend, and a commenter <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">here</a> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon-2010.html">at</a> Asheeshworld. In the photo of her and her new scarf, you can also see Ward Cunningham. I suggest reading her <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2011/07/10/0">wrap-up</a> about the conference, and checking out the <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/2011/wiki/Learn_Tech_Management_In_45_Minutes">notes from her talk</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't met Igal, but I've learned he's a fixture of the Portland tech scene. He's <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/users/1">user number one</a> on opensourcebridge.org and one of the original contributors to <a href="http://calagator.org/">calagator</a>, the most important event calendar in the Portland tech world. That's just a brief summary; follow <a href="http://twitter.com/igalko">him on Twitter</a> to keep in touch.</p>

<p>I started the conference a little shy, not wanting to introduce myself to people, so I hung out with Sumana. She talked to everyone she could find, and there I was standing next to her. On the first day, it was only because of Sumana's outgoingness that people knew who I was. On the second and third days, I was involved in two sessions: a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/711">panel on open source communities</a> and a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/705">talk about the OpenHatch training missions</a>.</p>

<p>I was extremely honored to be chosen. There were so many other spectacular people I met for the first time, like <a href="http://valerieaurora.org/">Valerie Aurora</a>, 
<a href="http://twitter.com/jarichaust">Jacinta Richardson</a>, <a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/">Brian Aker</a>, and <a href="http://alexlinsker.com/">Alex Linsker</a>. These are all people with three crucial traits: they're <em>extremely</em> knowledgeable, friendly, and opinionated. I'm glad I had a chance to attend and meet them!</p>

<p><em>Photo credits</em>: Thanks to <a href="http://wiki.mako.cc/Noah_Swartz">Noah Swartz</a> for the photo of me. Sumana's photo comes from <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical/54396">her post to wikitech-l</a>. Igal's comes from his <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/users/1">Open Source Bridge user profile</a>.

<p>The beautiful photo above is what reflections should look like. If you don't like Google's shimmering +1 buttons, try the <a href="http://blog.tommorris.org/post/7039918552/1-and-google-no-thanks-fuck-off">convenient AdBlock filter Tom Morris wrote</a>. I also block <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/images/nav_logo72.png">this image</a>.</p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 440px;"><p style="margin-top: 1em;">I have been reading a lot about Google+. I'm sure a lot of people put a lot of hard work into it. Lots of people seem to enjoy using it and appreciate its features. For my part, right now, when I see Google+ mentioned, the smile vanishes from my face.</p>

<p>I just have a few thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>It's anti-competitive.</strong> If you could ask Google, "How much for a shimmering +1 button next to every search result?" you would be laughed out of the room. But they managed to offer themselves that unique marketing opportunity. I know that (1) most regulators who see this anti-competitive behavior won't see it as an anti-trust violation, and (2) the damage is already done, and no retribution in the future can act fast enough to fix the unfair advantage Google gave itself in the Internet-mediated personal communication (and ad sales) markets.</p>

<p><strong>The shimmering is distracting, making my online search experience worse.</strong> I know that Google is holding nothing back; they are willing to distract me from my intended use of Google in order to branch out their business. (If you haven't seen the shimmering +1 button, it's next to every web search result, and if you mouse over <em>any</em> part of the result, it does a wavy dance.)</p>

<p><strong>The most-touted feature is a clone of Diaspora.</strong> This by itself is fine; software should help users by having the best features imaginable. But the enthusiasm I've seen within the free software community (like when I read about Google+ on Slashdot and Planet Debian) should at least <em>recognize</em> that Google "circles" are a <a href="http://raventools.com/blog/google-copies-diaspora/">clone of Diaspora's Aspects</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Centralization on the web feels like a personal attack.</strong> Corporations on the web are like unstoppable machines rolling us toward a future of corporate eavesdropping, central points of failure, and end-users sold en masse to advertisers. It enables a future of individual "platform owners" who can change the lived experience of untold hundreds of millions with tweaks that benefit their actual customers (the advertisers). There's not much I can do about that. I happen to take this personally: I am part of a small culture of people who run their own mail and web servers and understand the importance of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">software freedom</a>. This is a part of my identity. I watch as its traces online vanish, replaced by something more efficient and terrifying. It <a href="http://makesad.us/">makes me sad</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'm probably going to end up using it despite all these pain points.</strong> That's how I know that I am being steamrolled. The reasons I have given above are not reasons to <em>not use</em> Google+. They're just reasons that I'm going to frown all the way to the address bar.</p>

<p>In weeks to months to years, the service will grow an enthusiastic userbase. At that point, personally, I'll have to make a choice between connecting with those people on their terms, or not staying in touch with them. Already, professionally, the idea has already come up on <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">#openhatch</a> that Google+ could help us reach people willing to contribute to open source. Are my gripes worth holding OpenHatch back, or worth isolating myself over? Probably not.</p>
