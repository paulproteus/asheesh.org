        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/scala-crash-course.html">Announcing the Scala Crash Course (for women & their friends)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Here is an email I just sent to the email list for PHASE,
the Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, let me introduce myself: Hi, everybody!</p>
<p>I'm Asheesh Laroia, as the "From:" header on this email message indicates. 
I'm also a Python user, former ocaml user in college, and Debian 
developer. (Maybe none of those will make me any friends in PHASE....)</p>
<p>I'm writing this because Yuvi and I are planning an event on the Friday 
evening before Scalathon: a low-cost Scala crash course.</p>
<p>http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/17397558/ says a little more; I 
can, too:</p>
<p>My goal (I won't claim to speak for Yuvi) is to help encourage a diverse 
Scalathon that brings new people into the community. By being a "crash 
course" for people who already know some Scala or another functional 
programming language, we aim to select for people who can contribute 
during the big hackathon on so many Scala projects during the weekend. By 
insisting that attendees of the crash course attend Scalathon, we hope to 
use the time to enrich the Scalathon event.</p>
<p>The event has a stipulation that I'm borrowing from an effort called 
RailsBridge: to attend, you must either be a woman, or find a woman who 
will bring you as her guest. The idea here is to simultaneously make sure 
anyone who wants to can attend, while also inviting women to join 
Scala-based communities.</p>
<p>The event is separate from Scalathon; it's an effort to feed people into 
Scalathon.</p>
<p>If you are a woman who is thinking about attending Scalathon but wants to 
make sure you have time to sharpen your Scala chops, this event is for 
you. If you know such a person, please send her a copy of this email. If 
you're a man in the same situation, we hope you can find the woman in your 
life who is, too, so that she can invite you.</p>
<p>So -- that's what I'm working with Yuvi.</p>
<p>A bit more personally, I met Yuvi because I work on an open source 
community outreach website called OpenHatch: http://openhatch.org/. He and 
I met at a meet-up for that site last year, when I lived in West Philly (on 
a beautiful street called Hazel). He and I organized a Penn-based open 
source hackathon you can read about at 
http://opensource.com/life/10/11/introducing-students-world-open-source-day-1 
. Right now I'm based in the Boston area, in Somerville, MA.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what you all think.</p>

		<p><i>Current mood</i>: moved
</p><p>Today is an amazingly great day. I wrote a blog post about an event that I put together, and an attendee then followed-up by writing a long-form comment.
</p><p>The thing is, the attendee did a far better job of writing about the event than I did.
</p><p>The amount of emotional positive reinforcement that this comment gave me is hard to overstate.
</p><p>You can find it toward the end of <a href="http://blog.lydiapintscher.de/2011/04/18/how-vidalia-and-gimp-found-new-contributors-just-by-asking/">the blog post</a> but I hope you'll read the copy below.
</p><p>I am stunned and awed. I guess I have my work set out for me.
<pre>8----&lt; CUT HERE &gt;-----8
</pre>
<p>I have never written software for an open source project. I am not subscribed to any development mailing lists. I have not been in a chat room on IRC for months. Yet I was delighted to see this tweet from @torproject on 04/15/2011…
</p><p>“https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-get-involved – Join us in #vidalia on irc.oftc.net today at 13:00 UTC.”
</p><p>The blog post described the “Build It” initiative for the Vidalia project, where people would be available to help you setup your build environment and compile the project.
</p><p>I have wanted to participate in open source projects for quite a while, but never really knew where to begin. I have experience (and enjoy) writing software. I am glad to learn the languages they are using. I know how to compile software. I’m glad to learn their versioning 
system and build system. I looked into participating in several projects, but felt like I would be more of a burden than a help considering the relatively small amount that I was intending to contribute. I can generally figure anything out on my own, but it’s nice to have 
somewhere to turn when you are struggling with something “simple”. I thought that this would be a perfect opportunity for me, since I already preach the use of Tor and Vidalia. I’ve even demonstrated the bundle at a local LUG meeting.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>I joined the OFTC #vidalia room and waited… nothing happened around 13:00 UTC, so I figured I’d missed the event. They began around 13:30 UTC and walked us through the source code download process and compilation process. They directed our attention to the Volunteer page and 
the HACKING page. chiiph even suggested several simple OSX-specific tickets for me personally, since he knew that I was building on OSX.
</p><p>I’ve already managed to contribute a patch for one ticket and am ready to begin a second ticket. I wouldn’t have done it without help and feedback from chiiph and others.
</p><p>I am confident that there are many others who would be glad to help out with one or more of their favorite open source projects if they only had some place to begin. I hope that other project members or leaders offer a similar “Build It” events for their users.
