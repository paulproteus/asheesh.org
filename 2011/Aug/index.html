        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/openhatch-non-profit.html">OpenHatch round two: the non-profit
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>For the past year or two, readers of asheesh.org (including those on
Planet Debian) have been hearing on and off about OpenHatch, a project that
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/move-to-atlanta.html">began in Atlanta</a>
two summers ago.
</p><p>The <a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch website</a> has been a place
to find out how new contributors can get involved in free software.
Lately, I've discovered how much
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/why-outreach.html">fun</a>
it is to help people get involved. I've also discovered oodles of
<a href="http://opensource.com/life/10/11/introducing-students-world-open-source-day-1">enthusiasm</a> for learning
more about joining an open source project.
</p><p>So I've been transitioning OpenHatch to be more of a non-profit
and to work on more of those outreach events,
and particularly I've been transitioning my life to support me
(self-funded) working on that effort full-time for a year. If there's
one thing I learned while creating a startup under incubation, it
was how to save money.
</p><p>The OpenHatch blog has
<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2011/openhatch-gains-full-time-project-lead-transitioning-into-a-non-profit/">the rest of the story</a>. Here's
a taste:
</p>
<blockquote>
I’m writing to announce three big changes for the project. First, 
OpenHatch is changing its organizational structure to reflect our 
not-for-profit goals. Second, we’ll emphasize our new work beyond 
the website, building and promoting outreach events that bring 
new people into the free software community. Finally, I am taking 
a year to do that full-time as the project lead of OpenHatch in 
Somerville, MA.
</blockquote>
<p>This change has been a long-time coming, and it's thanks to so many people
who have given advice and feedback along the way. One special shout-out goes
to <a href="http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn/">Bradley Kuhn</a>, who told me in March 2010 that
OpenHatch should be a non-profit.
</p><p>I hope you'll <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2011/openhatch-gains-full-time-project-lead-transitioning-into-a-non-profit/">read more</a>.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/accidentally-sexist.html">Women, men, and accidentally being a jerk (at the Desktop Summit)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>The first day of the Desktop Summit was yesterday, Saturday, August 6. I loved it and gave a presentation. There are two very different stories I can tell on the topic of gender equality in 
free software. I'll start with the bad.
</p>
<hr />
<p>It's pretty easy, in the U.S. at least, to get people of privilege to stop using terms that evoke centuries of oppression from slavery. It's harder to ask people to stop doing that to women. 
I'm writing this post to ask for that.
</p><p>There were two different times that people I generally respect used words that historically have been used to hurt and minimize women.
</p><p><b>"Cygnus Solutions is prostitutes."</b> Dave Neary was delivering a talk (that I found impressively informative) called,
"<a href="https://www.desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/cost-going-it-alone">The cost of going it alone</a>". When the talk covered the
cost (in time and money) of getting your corporation's code into the community branch of an open-source project, he pointed out you could hire someone with the skills. Cygnus was the go-to 
company for that in the 1990s; to explain that Cygnus does not care who they work for, he said the sentence in bold.
</p><p><b>"The OpenSuSE Build Service is a slut."</b> I was at a party at a hackerspace last night. Someone who I admire for his work in free in free software, both technical and community, was joking with 
me about that no one should compile (or use) GTK. I riffed on the joke and remarked, "The OpenSuSE build service will build anything." He replied with the sentence in bold.
</p><p>"Slut" and "prostitute" are terms that recall the objectification of women. They're terms that attempt to measure a woman's worth as a sex object.
</p><p>It's not nice to the many women in attendance to bring that up.
</p><p>You might not have thought this through. You might want to read one woman's take "<a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/on-sluts-rape-and-fuckery/">On Sluts, Rape, and Fuckery</a>". Give it a read.
</p><p>Then, give it a rest.
</p><p>The thing is, this matters all the time. That's why I have to call you two out on it.
</p><p>Now for the happy story.
</p>
<hr />
<p>While watching the Desktop Summit's <a href="https://www.desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/gnome-and-kde-interns-showcase">intern showcase</a>, I was floored.
</p><p>One hacker implemented Off-The-Record instant messaging for Telepathy. Another implemented pluggable back-ends for Getting Things GNOME, a task manager. I heard about overwhelming documentation 
and usability improvements to GNOME mainstays Cheese and Anjuta. In a short summer, these students made huge changes.
</p><p>For most of them, this was the first time they delivered any sort of presentation. Every single talk was delivered in earnest and enthusiasm. They told us about the work they had done and what 
might happen in the future.
</p><p>The other remarkable thing about the intern presentations was the demographics. I didn't keep count, but it seemed like as many women as men presented. We heard about hugely-important changes to 
documentation, code, and usability. People from central Europe, South Asia (<a href="http://asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">yay</a>), and Brazil took the stage.
</p><p>I hope that is the future of free software.
</p>
<hr />
<p>There are two things I want to see for our community.
</p><p>I want to know that people are respected and not reminded of centuries of oppression.
</p><p>I also want to see our community grow in size and diversity.
</p><p>I treat these issues as separate. We should choose respectful words when we speak not because we want more women to show up, but because it part of the expectation of decency that we should be 
able to expect from each other.
</p><p>And I failed the community when I did not make it clear <b>there and then</b> that this kind of language is not okay with me. It took me a day to understand this failure, so here I am writing 
this blog post.
</p><p>P.S. Thanks to <a href="http://www.littlegreenriver.com/">Karen Rustad</a> for her feedback while writing this post.

</p><p>It shares a title with the talk I gave at PyCon, and I expect it will be similar. There are some
points I will improve on, and some new pieces to cover:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://blog.lydiapintscher.de/2011/04/18/how-vidalia-and-gimp-found-new-contributors-just-by-asking/">Build It events</a>

</li><li> The <a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/events/2011-August/000192.html">plan</a> to run more student immersion events
</li></ul>
<p>In high school, I used to read the <a href="http://dot.kde.org/">Dot</a> daily. I was
surprised and thrilled to see that they chose to list my talk in their
<a href="http://dot.kde.org/2011/05/20/desktop-summit-team-unveils-exciting-program-talks">announcement of the summit</a>.
</p><p>If you'll be there, too, let me know! Let's hang out.
</p><p>And if you want to work one-on-one(-ish) on helping your project improve diversity or outreach,
I will be in Berlin until August 14, and <i>extremely</i> happy to spend time with people.

<h3>Creative Commons needs someone good. If not me, then who? (2006)</h3>

<p>At the end of 2006, graduation was looming. I had to find a job.</p>

<p>The Johns Hopkins CS jobs emails seemed to list two kinds of work in the Baltimore
area: cutting-edge artificial intelligence research to build better killing machines
for defense contractors, and mind-numbing Java development jobs that
built expensive, hard-to-use websites for government agencies.</p>

<p>Faced with these options, I thought I'd ask Creative Commons if they wanted
to hire a software engineer. (I had just interned there the summer of 2006.) To my
glee and relief, they said, "Yes." In the blink of an eye, I said "Yes" back.</p>

<p>Then Google recruiters started emailing me. They suggested I apply to be
a Site Reliability Engineer. They needed people who
understood Linux-based performance issues and software architecture, could
critique other engineers' designs before they took code to production, and
be nimble system administrators. That sounded exactly like what I enjoyed doing.
But I told them I already had plans.</p>

<p>While having lunch at Wegmans, I explained this to my parents.</p>

<p>"You could at least <em>interview</em> with them," pleaded my mother.</p>

<p>"No," I explained. "Google has enough resources to find someone who will help it achieve its goals. Creative Commons doesn't necessarily."</p>

<p>The day-to-day work at Google would have been more technically challenging, but
my actions weren't going to make a net difference on the world. At CC, they would.</p>

<h3>My own projects also need that push (2009)</h3>

<p>In late April 2009, I was stunned to
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/move-to-atlanta.html">learn</a> that Shotput Ventures funded
a project Nelson, Raffi, and I applied to start. It's now called <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>.</p>

<p>I had started working at Creative Commons because I wanted to push the world in that direction.
I had enough self-confidence to think that if it wasn't me coding for them (and promoting them),
it could be someone less effective.</p>

<p>In 2009, I realized that the same applied to my own projects. If there is a direction I want to
push the world, it's not going that way unless <em>I</em> push it.</p>

<p>Thus was one more layer of humility removed.</p>

<h3>This job will teach me skills I want -- on their time (2011)</h3>

<p>Recently, I've considered other ways to spend my time: for example, building a system administration co-op to 
combat corporate cloud services with freedom-loving humans, or organizing urban kitchens for hungry 
yuppies to practice cooking during their lunch breaks.</p>

<p>To understand how to make the sysadmin co-op succeed,
I needed to understand devops-style system automation tools. A few months ago, while working on
<a href="http://mirocommunity.org/">Miro Community</a>, I had the chance to redefine the service requirements
using <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/introduction/">Puppet</a>. Once I realized that it would
help me plan my own future, I lept at the task.</p>

<p>This year, it struck me that if a job can teach me something I want to know in order to
make my own projects succeed better, <em>that</em> could be a reason to take it. That includes
future projects, and goals with a timeline of 5-10 years.</p>

<p>Until recently, I thought
that jobs were devices for turning my time into some change in the world; I didn't realize I could
retain some of the value in the transaction.
In other words, I realized that I'm not an invisible worker pushing the world around. I'm a 
permanent fixture in my life.</p>

<p>Thus was removed one layer of self-effacement.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'll conclude with some advice to myself:</p>

<p>Don't forget about yourself. Not just your vision of the world; things like, What skills are you gaining? How does this job help you succeed at what you'll be doing five years from now?</p>

was written about someone else. But his words apply so well to me that I
will mis-quote him here.
</p><p>I'll pretend it's about OpenHatch just so that the effect is more personal
on me.
</p>
<blockquote>
He was great when I spoke to him on telephone a few years ago but I and many others, who were working on or interested in working on the OpenHatch project, found it nearly impossible to 
communicate with him meaningfully via email.  I understand by his own statements at the time that his attention was very divided and unfortunately OpenHatch was receiving very little 
attention from him.  Almost everyone involved with OpenHatch at the time was failing to give the attention to the project which would have been needed to make the project a great success.  
The problem was not Asheesh himself but a culture which pervaded the environment he was working in.  This is a general problem of small projects managed by people pursing 
too many other interests.
