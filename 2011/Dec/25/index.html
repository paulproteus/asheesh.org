</a>
       </h1>
		<p>In fifth and sixth grade, I used to play the baritone horn. A few weekends ago,
I played a show with the Russian Nonsemble. Look for me in a blue shirt and tie:
</p><p><img src="/pub/image/music/img-photo-87130.jpg" width="500" height="373" />
</p><p>When I joined the Brighton public school system in fifth grade, other students had been
playing musical instruments for a year. I tried a few different options, and I
settled on the baritone. Maybe I really liked the sound, or how buzzing works with
a mouthpiece and combines with the entire horn. Maybe I was suggestible and accepted
something that the band needed.
</p><p>I learned the instrument on bass clef, which was its own oddity. It was a little confusing
to use bass clef in band and treble clef in chorus, but I managed. (Maybe this exercise
taught me something about the concept of equivalence.)
</p><p>There is something relaxing about playing the baritone: I am not keeping
the melody. The tone quality I send out is not, at least in a fifth grade
band, make or break the performance. One downside is that, with the highly
repetitious lines, it can be easy to get lost.
</p><p>Early in the sixth grade, our band director asked for volunteers to learn
the French horn. Steve Marler picked it up for the musical challenge. I picked
it up because I was willing to fill an institutional need.
</p><p>It was a lot of fun to play French horn. Well, it was a challenge, at least.
Every single group performance setting I had for the French horn -- from
sixth grade through high school, through the Johns Hopkins concert band --
there was someone sitting next to me who was a full notch better at me.
It was disheartening, to be honest.
</p><p>I stopped playing horn somewhere in college. For a while I played mellophone
in the Johns Hopkins pep band, but that wound down eventually.
</p><p>About a year ago, my friend Irina invited me to be part of a band,
for which she lent me a baritone.
</p><p>Halfway through the concert you see above,
I began to do more than just read the music. I listened to the sound of the band
and looked at my bandmates, making <i>bom-pom</i> sounds on the horn while bobbing
up and down with the rhythm of the song we were playing.
</p><p>Thanks to Jess Schumann for taking the picture!
