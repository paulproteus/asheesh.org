</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I've noticed that I've been using asheesh.org lately to write
positive things and announcements, but I don't have a good outlet for sharing criticism
of the projects that I like.
</p><p>I have used asheesh.org
for writing critical pieces sometimes,
like last year's <a href="http://asheesh.org/note/free-culture/fsf-on-windows-mobile.html">note about some FSF activism</a>.
For all the small ways that projects I like could be improved, I don't want to
write a blog post that implies that I <i>only</i> have negative things to say.
If I did that, when new readers come to asheesh.org, they'll see a big long complaint
and think that I don't like the project as a whole.
</p><p>I'm going to try something new, then: when I want to write a bit of criticism
for a project I generally like, I will stash it in the comments section: I will write up a blog post explaining
something positive about the effort, and then my alter ego
will leave a comment taking a more critical perspective.
(His name will be
<i>Another Waffle</i>, a punny reference to my etymologies course at CTY in 2000.)
</p><p>I will also apply this to my <i>own</i> projects, like on the recent
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/community/boston-python-meetup.html">note about the Boston Python meetup's gender diversity</a>.
I think it's especially useful on notes about my own work; when I write announcements that
mention the positive, I sometimes feel a bit hollow about not mentioning my nagging doubts.
This way, I can still share my mixed feelings while retaining the announcement format.
</p><p>Constructive criticism is important, I believe, as is context.

<h2>Thu, 19 May 2011</h2>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/community/boston-python-meetup.html">Boston Python Meetup, May 18
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Today there was a
<a href="http://meetup.bostonpython.com/events/17330576/">Boston Python Meetup on science</a>. Two biologists presented. One-sixth
of the attendees were women.
</p><p>Ned Batchelder found the presenters and invited them to speak. I had the pleasure of meeting one, Geraldine, at the last
Boston Python hack night.
</p><p>At the last minute, I couldn't make it due to bad planning: lots of overdue work and having to cook dinner for my house.
</p><p>Afterward, Ned found me on IRC and gave me a quick summary of attendees' demographics, gender-wise:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;nedbat&gt; paulproteus:  attendance tonight at the meetup: 55 men, 11 women.
</blockquote>
<p>I'm <i>really</i> happy about that. It means that things are changing.
In January, when I first attended, there was one woman in a room of about fifty.
</p><p>I'm proud that I sparked something positive here. 
In December, I thought about putting together an introductory programming workshop for women and their friends, and
in January, Deborah Nicholson joined me to make sure it would happen.
Ned invited us to do it as part of the Meetup group; in March, I was part of a team of instructors and co-organizers
who ran the first one. In the new staff, Jessica McKellar is most notable; she has been doing most of the organizing lately.
</p><p>The trend of more women in attendance was already visible in April. In this regular monthly May meetup,
we accomplished this level of one-sixth. I'm really proud of that forward progress.
</p><p>I think there a few things going on here:
</p>
<ul><li> More women <i>know about</i> the meetup, at all, because we've been forced to do gender-oriented outreach (for the Meetup as a whole) with the Boston Python Workshop. This works to undo the accidental bias reinforcement problem where meetup attendees invite their friends to the next one, who probably are like them.
</li><li> Because people see that we are running a gender diversity-oriented outreach program, prospective attendees judge that we are not going to be a bunch of sexist jerks.
</li><li> Ned invited a woman to be one of the speakers, which also suggests we are not sexist jerks.
</li><li> Because people see that other women are attending and speaking, they know they will not be the only person of their gender.
</li></ul>
<p>In this regard, I think that introductory programming teaching is almost a sideshow: it's not just that
we are <i>creating</i> more women who are interested in Python. We're also attracting women who already
have programming chops to attend the Meetup. If you were a woman browsing tech events wondering
which one to attend, you might pick ours because it seems more likely you'll have a good time.
</p><p>(I may seem a bit blasé about the teaching, so let me clarify: I see our workshop as having two goals.
One is a service to Ned Batchelder and the attendees of the Meetup, which is to make the workshop
a more diverse environment. I'm interested in that as a test-case of what it takes to diversify small,
visible software communities. The second goal is to change the world more broadly: we find people who
would like to learn programming but haven't, and we diversify the pool of people who can program.
This goal is <i>hugely</i> important, and it's worth running the workshops even
if the Boston Python Workshop becomes an even male-female split.)
</p><p>I'm pretty happy. I will heed the advice of Bad Religion:
</p>
<blockquote>
Don't be a henchman. <br />
Stand on your laurels.
</blockquote>
<p>Back to work, then. There's more to do.
</p><p><b>Update</b>: How to join in
</p><p>In my enthusiasm, I nearly forgot to write about how you can get
in touch with us and do something similar for your communities.
</p><p>The best thing to do is:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/events">Join the OpenHatch events mailing list</a>, where people show up to plan similar events and discuss how theirs went.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Second update</b>: Ned informs me:
</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;nedbat&gt; paulproteus:  at the beer after-party, two new women and one new man showed up: 13/56: 18.84% <br />
&lt;nedbat&gt; there were 25 people at the bar i would guess.
</blockquote>
<p>Make of those numbers what you will.

</p><p>Next week, I am going to be at:

</p><p>My goals for the conference:
</p>
<ul><li> On <a href="http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2011/program/#day3">Day 3</a>, participate in a panel called <i>How to keep and make productive libre graphics projects?</i>
</li><li> Talk about the success of the recent <a href="http://blog.lydiapintscher.de/2011/04/18/how-vidalia-and-gimp-found-new-contributors-just-by-asking/">Build It events</a>.
</li><li> Learn more about the world of free software graphics app development.
</li><li> Enjoy the opportunity to speak French.
</li><li> Say 'hi' to old friends like Jon Phillips.
</li><li> Give chocolate to Michael Terry for <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/gimp-developer%40lists.xcf.berkeley.edu/msg22141.html">staying positive</a> on a recent gimp-deve thread.
</li></ul>
<p>I'm going to arrive in Montreal at 6:30am on Tuesday on an overnight Greyhound bus from Boston. So another goal:
</p>
<ul><li> Make it through Tuesday without embarrassingly falling asleep in public.
</li></ul>
<p>If you want to say hi to me during the conference, email me and make sure we meet up!

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Sometimes, I get annoyed when I feel that other people are being
pedantic and wasting people's time with an issue that, in my opinion,
doesn't matter. "There are more important things to think about!
We have work to do, saving the world!" I think.
</p><p>Sometimes I add, "This conversation is surely alienating to new
people on the list, which makes it hard for our movement to grow."
</p><p>Sometimes I think that I do a reasonably okay job with this, like
<a href="http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2011-April/001945.html">a recent OpenHatch devel list post</a>,
where I explained my feelings and the standard I hold myself to.
</p><p>But I just spent too much of the past 20 minutes arguing about if it's
important to call <a href="http://mediagoblin.org/">it</a> GNU MediaGoblin, or
if it should be okay to call it just MediaGoblin casually sometimes.
</p><p>I was trying to argue that the GNU MediaGoblin folks should fiercely resist
to chastize people when they forget the "GNU".
</p><p>In my passionate arguing, I became a naming pedant (rather,
a backwards anti-naming-pedant pedant).
</p><p>That's the same trap.
