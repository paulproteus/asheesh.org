        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/corporations/behind-bars-draft.html">How To Put Corporations in Jail and Prison (draft)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>In the U.S., some crimes carry jail or prison terms for the persons who commit them. Some of the persons
who commit these crimes are so-called "natural persons" -- people like you and me. Some of them
are corporations. This brief essay explains how and why to apply prison sentences to these artificial persons.
</p><p>I am not a lawyer. I do live in a country with laws, and I worry that these "artificial persons" can skirt
the law by being structured to avoid jail time. So I propose this draft, and I am interested in feedback.
</p>
<h3 id="w_1-a-brief-summary-of-jail-and-prison">1. A brief summary of jail and prison</h3>
<p>First, let us review life for natural persons when they are convicted of a crime with a prison term.
Prisoners may find themselves in a minimum-security institution, where they are given some small
degree of autonomy, limited (but non-zero) access to communication systems like postal mail,
telephones, and in-person visits, and are put to work. Persons who commit violent crimes and constitute
a risk to other inmates may be incarcerated in a medium- or high-security facility; in these,
inmates are carefully tracked and intensive barriers and check-points prevent too-great movement.
</p><p>It can be disruptive for a person to find himself or herself behind bars, but it is a disruption
that the legal system is willing to make so that the public can enjoy a law-abiding society.
</p><p>Life in prisons is still <i>life</i>: inmates may always eat, drink water, think to
themselves, and (as far as I know) make written notes to themselves. Many famous activists have spent
time in jail or prison and gone on to continue their careers. Prisoners in low-security
facilities may enjoy lots of communication with other persons, so long as it does not require
the use of communication technology.
</p><p>Persons spending time in prison may continue to own property outside of the prison.
Their ability to use it while incarcerated is minimal to nonexistent, but they may have bank accounts,
investments, or other financial instruments that appreciate in value.
</p>
<h3 id="w_2-how-the-structure-of-corporations-makes-law-enforcement-harder">2. How the structure of corporations makes law enforcement harder</h3>
<p>Now that we have a concept of what prison is like, let us carefully consider what it means to
be a corporation. Corporations are legal constructions, created to
achieve a specific end. They have a primary place of business where individual natural persons meet
to do work to help the corporation achieve those ends. Most corporations are created for the
private profit of their founders.
</p><p>The corporation is, fundamentally, a legally-approved
veil over the collective activity of individual persons.
This corporate veil limits the <i>financial</i> liability for its Directors; if the corporation owes
rent on its property, for example, the Directors are not responsible personally for this debt.
Virtually all actions of corporations are about the transfer of money. The existence of
this structure is widely-considered a good, efficient thing.
</p><p>Some actions of a corporation go beyond the transfer of money; some actions are criminal.
At the moment, individual natural persons who commit crimes as part of their
duties to the corporation may find themselves in court and possibly in jail. This can
flow all the way up the chain to the Directors.
</p><p>But if an employee is asked by her manager to commit a crime for the private
inurement of the corporation, she is the one most at-risk for criminal proceedings.
If a corporation profits from check fraud, the fines may be smaller than the profits
earned.
</p><p>The incentives are mis-aligned: if an investor calculates that the financial punishment for
breaking the law will not hurt the corporation, he might urge the corporation to flout
the law. The result might be dramatically increased profits with a side-effect of
an employee or a Director in jail.
</p><p>There is an elegant solution to this problem: when an agent for the corporation commits a
crime with a jail term, the corporation should spend some time incarcerated as well.
This brings us to the final part: the mechanics of applying jail and prison terms to
corporations.
</p>
<h3 id="w_3-how-to-put-companies-behind-bars">3. How to put companies behind bars</h3>
<p>Rather than painstakingly identify the employees most responsible for lawbreaking
within a corporation, it may be simpler to put the corporation behind bars.
Practically speaking, this means moving the primary place of business of the
corporation to a jail or prison.
</p><p>In this regime, when a company is in jail, the employees must go to the jail
and subject themselves to the standard restrictions of the jail as they go about
their business. If the company has committed a violent offense (perhaps
the calculated murder of citizens who live near its place of toxic waste dumping),
then while employees are contributing their time to the corporation, they
would be subject to highly-secured perimeter fences and close supervision.
</p><p>Just like a natural person, the corporation can continue its life while in prison.
It may have limited access to communication technology, but (depending on
the security level of the facility) employees will be able to take notes
on paper, send checks in the mail, plan the corporation's future actions, and possibly
attend meetings with each other. If this is not enough to maintain the
corporation's activities, it should have considered that before committing
criminal acts.
</p><p>One downside to this system is that as corporations are increasingly convicted
of crimes, their employees could fill up our already-stretched prison capacity.
This, and other practical problems, are easy to address if you consider the
spirit of this proposal. The restrictions of prison life could be applied by
sending jail wardens to corporate headquarters, where employees are scrutinized
and restricted under the same rules as they would be in prison. The warden
can be responsible for ensuring limits on communication technology use are
enforced.
</p><p>It can be disruptive for a corporation to find itself
behind bars, but it is a disruption
that the legal system should be willing to make so that the public can enjoy a law-abiding society.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/reflection/important-problems.html">Work on important problems
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>A friend pointed me to a
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">transcript</a>
of Richard Hamming's motivational
speech, "You and your research." In the speech, Hamming (the famous inventor of
the Hamming code, an early and vital error-correction algorithm) discusses points
that make a researcher generate <i>important</i> results for the field. (<strike>I think it was Blake who sent me the link.</strike> I seem to have no idea how I found it initially.)
</p><p>I'll now take a moment and mis-quote Hamming, pretending he's giving advice to activists rather
than scientists:
</p>
<blockquote>
If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work. It’s
perfectly obvious. Great activists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of
important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack
them. Let me warn you, ‘important problem’ must be phrased carefully. The three
outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at
Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you
want to mention. We didn’t work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity.
They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It’s not the
consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.
That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most activists don’t work on
important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average activist, so far as I can make
out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be
important and he also doesn’t believe that they will lead to important problems.
</blockquote>
<p>He tells great stories, and you should read the transcript. Here, however,
is a summary of his points:
</p>
<ul><li> A handful of people do excellent science repeatedly. It does not boil down to pure luck (though luck does remain important). Courage and hard-work are huge factors.
</li><li> As you grow older, you will be tempted to only work on large problems. Instead, Shannon urges us to "continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow."
</li><li> Necessity is the mother of invention. When you have a resource constraint, you will be forced to address it, perhaps in a novel and generally-useful way.
</li><li> Be committed to your research question, not your current results. Take note of the places where your data disagree with your theory. You'll need those places later.
</li><li> When you see a good attack, drop everything and focus on it until you find out if it will work.
</li><li> If you work with your office as an open door, within a decade you will know where the field has moved-to in a way that closed-door workers will not.
</li><li> When solving a problem, consider how it can be "characteristic of a class" of problem rather than just one isolated problem.
</li><li> You must become good at presenting ("selling") your work as well as your motivations.
</li><li> Avoid the personality defect of wanting total control. This prevents other people from helping you. Generally, learn how to use the system. That includes being willing to <i>appear to conform</i>.
</li><li> Avoid the personality defect of excessive ego assertion. "Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first−class science?"
</li><li> Gain the personality boon of seeing the positive side of things, even constraints. Especially self-set constraints.
</li><li> Know thyself.
</li></ul>
<p>The Q&A, and the full speech, get the blood pumping. <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">Give it a read</a>.
