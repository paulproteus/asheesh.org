        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/free-culture/network.html">Why it's important to defeat the network management infrastructure
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I see the Internet as an ongoing conversation between millions of computers. Some of these computers are
controlled by me or by my friends. When network administrators make it harder for our computers
to send messages to each other, I get upset.
</p><p>Angry, actually.
</p>
<h2 id="w_high-school">High school</h2>
<p>I didn't always feel quite so strongly about this.
</p><p>Twelve years ago, I was enjoying a foray into running a server at home. I was excited to connect to
it from the Brighton High School computer network. I couldn't connect, though; I discovered that the high school's Internet
connection was filtered through a proxy that only would connect to web servers.
</p><p>I had an SSH server I wanted to connect to, so I could read my email in
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/alpine">PINE</a>. SSH isn't the web, so the proxy
wouldn't let me through.
</p><p>Then I learned about <a href="http://nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html">GNU httptunnel</a>. This is a pair of
programs:
</p>
<ul><li> a <i>server</i>, that sits on my server at home and runs a fake web server; and
</li><li> a <i>client</i>, that I run at school, that lets me connect through the fake web server to the SSH service.
</li></ul>
<p>After some experimentation, I got the tools working.
</p><p>From time to time, I would work on a file at home
and forget to bring a copy to school. Now I could use the tunnel to connect to my desktop and download it.
</p><p>From this experience, I took two lessons:
</p>
<ol><li> Whatever network restrictions there are, I probably want to circumvent them.
</li><li> It will probably be reasonably easy to do so.
</li></ol>
<p>The experience reminds me of John Gilmore's famous quote:
</p>
<blockquote>The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed reading my email from school. I never felt I was endangering the high school network. I did
try to set up my tunnels as fast as possible in case a teacher wandered by.
</p>
<h2 id="w_a-conversation-between-computers">A conversation between computers</h2>
<p>To many people, the Internet is a set of resources that humans can access.
</p><p>To me, this is wrong for two important reasons:
</p>
<ol><li> It is factually incorrect.
</li><li> It is a political mistake.
</li></ol>
<p>Factually speaking, every time you request a web page, you send a request to a remote computer to send it to you. That computer, upon receiving
the request, can do whatever it wants.  It is, approximately, sheer luck that when you visit <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zvak0.jpg">an image like this</a> twice,
you see the same thing.
</p><p>Politically speaking, this perspective hides one of the real crimes committed by Internet censors: fraud.
</p><p>Four years ago or so, Comcast famously used <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/packet-forgery-isps-report-comcast-affair">heavy-handed techniques</a> to prevent users
from effectively using the BitTorrent file sharing software. If you belive in the Internet as a set of resources, there isn't all <i>that</i> much
to complain about. After all, they let users access the whole World-Wide Web.
</p><p>To see the world the way I do, you'll need some basic knowledge of Internet protocols. As a refresher,
if you are on computer A, sending a file to computer B, Internet traffic between them generally
looks like this.
</p><p>First, a handshake:
</p>
<ul><li> A -&gt; B: Hi
</li><li> B -&gt; A: Oh, hi!
</li><li> A -&gt; B: I'm going to send you a file
</li><li> B -&gt; A: Cool, go ahead.
</li></ul>
<p>Then the file transfer begins, sending chunks until they are all sent:
</p>
<ul><li> A -&gt; B: Here's one chunk
</li><li> B -&gt; A: Great, send more chunks
</li><li> A -&gt; B: All done sending
</li><li> B -&gt; A: Hooray! I just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWBmaKk32fE">love receiving files</a>!
</li><li> B -&gt; A: Okay, bye!
</li><li> A -&gt; B: Bye!
</li></ul>
<p>Comcast does something exciting: in order to make the file transfer fail,
Comcast sends you a specially-crafted message that appears to come from
computer B. It says, "Okay, bye!"
</p><p>So your computer stops sending.
</p><p>From a user's perspective, the file transfer stops. At the network perspective, Comcast lied.
Comcast is <i>impersonating</i> a remote party in a conversation.
</p><p>Imagine with me, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDOYN-6gdRE">for a moment</a>, that this is a phone conversation.
When you call certain people, your phone operator is interrupting the conversation to play a message specially crafted
to sound like your friend saying, "I have to go now!" You might hang up, thinking the call is over.
</p><p>As it happens, in the Comcast BitTorrent blocking case, you can work around the tactic: if you configure your computer to ignore all "Okay, bye!" messages,
the file transfer works fine.
</p><p>If you see the web as a collection of resources, you might ask why your ISP is blocking access to a
particular site. You might wonder why they're blocking BitTorrent.
</p><p>If you're me, you'd ask: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGMc3tWhuY0">What gives them the right</a> to lie about their identity when
talking to you? To impersonate the computer operated by your friend across the 'net?
</p><p>It strikes me as commercial fraud. Whatever sysadmin deployed this
automated fraud technology needs to be put in jail -- if not him, then his boss.
</p>
<h2 id="w_port-blocking">Port blocking</h2>
<p>Instead of actively impersonating a remote computer, another common tactic is to simply
drop certain messages on the floor. This is most of what we ask "firewalls" to do.
(Unless the network notifies you it did this,
you can consider this a lie by omission.)
</p><p>Many guest wifi networks drop Internet messages between computers based on the port number.
</p><p>Different ports, for readers who don't know, are typically used for different kinds of services.
A computer on the Internet can provide web service by listening on port number 80, and provide
inbound email service at the same time by listening on port 25. The secure login service ("SSH")
is usually found on port 22.
</p><p>One of my housemates recently sent me an email complaining that she couldn't connect to her
web hosting service. She was on someone else's wifi network. We eventually determined
the cause: the network was dropping messages her computer sent to the hosting service
on port 22. (Also, the organization in question outsourced their network management
services, so there was no one in the building she could complain to.)
</p><p>At this point, I got angry. The network admins are not making their network safer, but they are
making it harder for her to do what she wants. Port 22 is <i>not</i> a dangerous thing
to permit people to use.
</p><p>So I configured one of my servers to listen on a port she <i>could</i> access. Like the
GNU HTTP tunnel configuration I used in high school, the machine would relay messages
from her limited network into the real Internet. In this case, we used
<a href="http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml">sslh</a> on the server, and
<a href="http://www.statusq.org/archives/2008/07/03/1916/">configured her computer</a>'s SSH client
to use a "ProxyCommand."
</p><p>Moments like this remind me that the Internet -- that is, the routing of messages between computers,
between (inter) networks (net) -- is vanishing before my eyes. I'm lucky in that I remember the old way; I started to use the Internet
in an era where you could expect that packets would actually
be sent to their destination, not rudely dropped on the floor or impersonated.
</p>
<h2 id="w_summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Now, it is normal to see packets mangled by Internet service providers. ISPs forge IP headers,
sometimes
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Media#Proxy_servers">to make the network seem faster</a>,
other times to insert advertisements into other people's web pages. Usually
there is no way to opt out.
</p><p>What all these network tricks have in common is that the ISP impersonates one party in the conversation.
</p><p>When I ask the network to please send a message to another computer for me, I'm not asking to be lied-to.

</p>
<p>Three weekends ago, I participated in a <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp">Debian bug squashing party</a>. It was more fun than I had guessed!</p>
<p>The event worked: we squashed bugs. Geoffrey Thomas (geofft) organized it as an event for MIT's student computing group, SIPB. In this post, I'll review the good parts and the bad. I'll conclude with beaming photos of my two mentees and talk about the bugs they fixed.</p>
<p>So, the good:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Attendance</strong>. As <a href="https://luke.faraone.cc/">Luke</a> put it, when he arrived, there was hardly anyone there.  “Then people showed up! And then mentorship and pedagogy happened!” In all, 14 people attended, seven of whom are active in Debian or its derivatives (Ubuntu, Debathena).</li>
<li><strong>We took photos</strong>. Arthur took a wide panoramic photo, and I snapped a few good ones, too. (Thanks to Jessica McKellar for letting me borrow her camera.) Here's my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulproteus/sets/72157627510089068/with/6076878743/">full photo set</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Good, free pizza</strong>. Props to geofft for ordering from <a href="http://beautys-pizza.com/">Beauty's</a>, and props to SIPB for picking up the tab.</li>
<li><strong>We fixed bugs</strong>! I mentored two new Debian contributors through their first release-critical bug fix. Both of them said they would attend similar events in the future. One of my mentees is now idling and asking questions in the #debian-mentors IRC channel.</li>
<li><strong>The Debian Events team republished the event</strong>. MadameZou <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp">posted</a> the event to debian.org, giving it a nice stable URL.</li>
<li><strong>geofft made a good list of bugs to work on</strong>. He worked from the release-critical bug list, categorized the bugs by expected difficulty, and made somee short notes about how to fix the bug. This turned out quite useful.</li>
<li><strong>People printed music to the speakers</strong>. If this sounds weird, you should read the <a href="http://sipb.mit.edu/doc/using-sipbmp3/">SIPB documentation for how to use Gutenbach</a> (written by <a href="http://lizdenys.com/">Liz Denys</a>).</li>
<li><strong>We had a good ratio of developers to newcomers</strong>. This was hugely helpful; from what I saw, new people rarely waited very long for their questions to be answered. Thanks to Luke Faraone, Sam Hartman, Obey Arthur Liu, Karl Ramm, and Christine Spang from Debian, and Geoffrey Thomas from Debathena, for sharing knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event was a success, but as always, there are some things that could have gone more smoothly. Here's that list:</p>
<ul><li><strong>We hadn't prepared for people to do Debian development on Ubuntu</strong>. In particular, it took Luke and me about half an hour to come up with a pbuilder command line that worked.</li>
<li><strong>We didn't contribute to Ubuntu, just Debian</strong>. I actually think this is fine, but geofft did originally <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp">want people to work on both</a>. He was disappointed, and we could have managed to do that if we had done more prep.</li>
<li><strong>We could have reached more prospective attendees</strong>. I know earlier in the year, <a href="http://rhydd.org/">daf</a> organized a highly popular Debian packaging tutorial <a href="http://pika.mit.edu/">elsewhere on campus</a>. I didn't see any of those people at the event, and I think some would have attended if they had known about it.</li>
<li><strong>Some people wanted a bit more context</strong>. In particular, attendees asked me about what makes a bug release-critical and what it means to do a non-maintainer upload. We could have taken some time to explain these to the whole group; instead, we dove right into hacking. Because we had so many mentors, I think people did get their questions answered, but we can't sustain that if the event grows in size.</li>
<li><strong>Mentees didn't always get high-quality help</strong>. geofft suggested Jessica work on one bug, and when she had a question, she asked Luke Faraone. Luke wasn't familiar with the bug, and he skimmed it, not realizing that the bug changed issues midway through the bug log. As a result, his initial help was unhelpful. After Luke, Jessica, and the bug were on the same page (so to speak), Jessica received clear, sound answers to questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it turned out well! I did three NMUs, corresponding to three patches submitted for release-critical bugs by my two mentees. Those mentees were:</p>
<p><img src="//asheesh.org/pub/image/debian-bsp/6076850459_b49d2fb456.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Jessica enjoying herself" /></p>
<p><a href="http://jesstess.com/">Jessica McKellar</a> is a software engineer at <strike>Ksplice</strike> Oracle and a recent graduate of MIT's EECS program. She solved three release-critical bugs. This was her first direct contribution to Debian. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no&bug=636201">#636201</a>:  While updating the package for multiarch support, the maintainer of  wildmidi presumably made a typo. A single character was missing from a  "Replaces:" declaration in debian/control. This bug caused upgrades to  fail. Sam Hartman uploaded an NMU based on a patch Jessica  prepared.</li>
<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626420">#626420</a>: The scribus-doc package failed to build from source due to a missing build-depends entry. This one was super easy, and served as a good test package for setting up and using pbuilder.</li>
<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=565000">#565000</a>: The switch to 
gcc-4.5 left hubbub unable to build from source due to new GCC warnings that made -Wall fail on the source, although it would succeed with earlier versions of the package. This led to long philosophical discussions about the particularly most reasonable fix: removing -Wall, or adding a more specific exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jessica has since gotten involved in the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~twisted-dev/+archive/ppa">Twisted project's personal package archive</a>. Toward the end of the sprint, she explained, "I like fixing bugs. I will totally come to the next bug squashing party."</p>
<p><img height="500" width="281" alt="Noah grinning" src="//asheesh.org/pub/image/debian-bsp/6077392890_95567b4bd3.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.mako.cc/Noah_Swartz">Noah Swartz</a> is a recent graduate of Case Western Reserve University  where he studied Mathematics and played Magic. He is an intern at the MIT Media Lab where he contributes to <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/doppellab/">DoppelLab</a> in Joe Paradiso's <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/responsive-environments">Responsive Environments</a> group. This was definitely his first direct contribution to Debian. It was also one of the most intense command-line experiences he has had so far. Noah wasn't originally planning to come, but we were having lunch together before the hackathon, and I convinced him to join us.</p>
<p>Noah fixed <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625177">#625177</a>, a fails-to-build-from-source (FTBFS) bug in nslint. The problem was that "-Wl" was instead written in all lowercase in the debian/rules file, as "-wl". Noah fixed that, making sure the package properly built in pbuilder, and then spent some quality time with lintian figuring out the right way to write a debian/changelog.</p>
<p>That's a wrap! We'll hopefully have one again in a few months, and before that, I hope to write up a guide so that we run things even more smoothly next time.</p>
