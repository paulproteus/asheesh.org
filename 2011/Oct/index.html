</a>
       </h1>
		<p>There is a program that I love: <tt>bb</tt>.
</p><p><tt>bb</tt> is a demo of the famous ASCII Art library, aalib.
</p>
<center><pre>     dT8  8Tb     
    dT 8  8 Tb    
   dT  8  8  Tb   
&lt;PROJECT&gt;&lt;PROJECT&gt;
 dT    8  8    Tb 
dT     8  8     Tb
</pre>
</center>

<tt>bb</tt> is a demo-scene-type program that shows how <em>awesome</em>
automatic ASCII art is. The personalities of the people who made <tt>bb</tt>
shine through. It's surely one of my favorite programs in Debian, up there
with alpine. It's been in Debian since 1998.

<p><tt>bb</tt> has a serious bug, however:
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=123150">BB's "graphics" freeze when music starts</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the issue.
</p>
<ul><li> <tt>bb</tt> uses libmikmod to play sound.
</li><li> Back in the twentieth century, many of us thought it would be cool to have applications play sound through a system service called <a href="http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html">EsounD</a>. To enable that, the libmikmod maintainers added the ability for libmikmod to send audio to that daemon.
</li><li> libmikmod detects if your system uses esound, and if so, sends sound there by default.
</li><li> libmikmod's esound support is broken, and <tt>bb</tt> half-crashes (as per #123150) when it gets used.
</li><li> Today, nearly everyone's sound output goes through pulseaudio, which supports ALSA as well as the old esound protocol for backwards-compatibility.
</li></ul>
<p>So if your system (like most GNU/Linux systems) uses pulseaudio for sound, then
<tt>bb</tt> is broken. That means every Ubuntu user and most desktop Debian users can't use it.</p>
<p>There are a few possible fixes, depending on where you'd want to solve the problem. If you just
want bb to run on your own machine, without recompiling anything, you can adjust pulseaudio's configuration
(in /etc/pulse/default.pa) to disable esound support. If you want to do that, just comment out this line:</p>
<pre> load-module module-esound-protocol-unix</pre>
<p>We could also possibly patch <tt>bb</tt> so that it asks libmikmod not to use its esound "support."</p>
<p>I think the smarter thing to do is to adjust libmikmod. Since its esound support seems to be just plain broken,
it should be removed. At very least, it should not be the default when ALSA output is available. There
<i>is</i> a new upstream release of libmikmod, maybe the esound output is fixed.</p>
<p>In Debian, libmikmod is
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=628162">orphaned</a>.
When a package is orphaned,
it means that a new person must step in and <i>adopt</i> the package.
Debian packages need ongoing care
and commitment to fix issues and make changes like this that benefit the users.</p>
<p>In this case, you'd need to understand some C and be willing to maintain a shared library.
Maintaining a library in Debian requires attention to detail, but it is quite doable. Since you would be adopting an existing package, most of the work is already done for you.
I would also be quite willing to answer questions. If you're not a Debian developer, I would happily sponsor uploads of this package
into Debian so that the fixes are part of the distribution.</p>
<p>So: who will maintain libmikmod and fix <tt>bb</tt>? Could it be you?</p>
<p>It would make a <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/event/2011-bday.html">really great birthday present</a>
if the amazing <tt>bb</tt> program worked in the next Debian release. Leave a comment if you
have questions or are interested!</p>
<p>P.S. In a pinch, I can be convinced to maintain libmikmod myself, but I think this is a great opportunity for someone new to Debian to make a big difference.</p>

<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=november,ma,us">November</a>
(91 Belmont St, #2, 02143) on Fri Oct 21, at 7:30 PM, there will be snacks and drinks.

plenty old!

rejected. Herbert and I are tourists in the dunya.
</p><p>Also, I will be showing a music video once per hour. Mostly R.E.M. with
maybe a sprinkling of They Might Be Giants. Bad Religion, too? Who knows.
</p><p>You are all quite invited to invite people I would like!

       </h1>
		
<p>I admit it, I use nano for text editing from time to time.  Like 
right now, with this post.<p>

<p>nano is a simple text editor widely derided as being simple.  It also 
has most of the features I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular expression find/replace</li>
<li>Fast loading</li>
<li>Automatic word wrap when you want it, and easily-disabled word wrap 
when you don't</li>
<li>No insane modal-ness like vi</li>
<li>Ability to easily insert the results of shell commands into 
files</li>
<li>Really easy to use with context help all the time</li>
<li>Real ultimate freedom</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Syntax highlighting?</h4>

<p>Yeah.  <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-86562.html">Some 
Gentoo dudes</a> pointed out it had it in 2003.  The nano changelog 
indicates (from a quick skimming) that version nano-1.1.4 - 12/11/2001 
was the first with "Preliminary syntax highlighting support".</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>

&lt;helix&gt; I think it got syntax highlighting around the same time 
the hurd managed to be able to use shared memory

</blockquote>

<p>Also also (from <a 
href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/nano/">Freshmeat</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

This looks just like Pico. Truly this is a good editor. I'm impressed. 
Toga! Toga! Toga!

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//asheesh.org/pub/image/emily-clough/EmilyCloughBW.jpg" width="200" height="225">
<p>Emily Clough asks sharp questions.</p>
<p>Academically speaking, Emily <a href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/emily-clough">is</a> a doctoral candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard. She studies comparative politics and the political economy of development with a special research focus on private governance and child labor. But this is a personal story, written to celebrate <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>In 2007, I had just graduated from college and was working for Creative Commons as a programmer. I was awed by my sudden position near the center of a whirlwhind of copyright activism; at the same time, I wondered about what kind of impact the <a href="http://freeculture.org/">free culture movement</a> was making. Were we really empowering people? How many? Which ones?</p>
<p>For Thanksgiving Day 2007, I was planning to be on a flight to New Delhi to visit some family. The night before, I stayed up all night chatting with <a href="http://abhay.tumblr.com/">Abhay</a>, expecting to sleep on the plane. When I got to the airport, I discovered I didn't have a visa for India in my passport. Groggy and confused, I managed to visit the consulate and get a new visa.</p>
<p>So on Thanksgiving evening, a day usually filled with family and feasts, I had no plans. I explained this to my roommate Matt Baggott, and he invited me to a vegan Thanksgiving dinner hosted by his friend <a href="http://www.maenad.net/">Nori Heikkinen</a>. That was where I met Emily Clough.</p>
<p>Emily was interested in international development, and I told her about the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/License">activity</a> I was making to teach kids about Creative Commons. This was November 2007, and like much of the tech world, I was excited about <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a>. OLPC was creating inexpensive, highly-interactive learning computers to distribute to children all over the developing world. They would have free software on them, which kids could edit, and my activity was going to maybe ship with them.</p>
<p>Emily, ever thoughtfully critical, wondered about the possibility of gender bias.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emily: "How are they identifying which children get computers?"</p>
<p>Asheesh: "I think they ask schools to go through their rosters and ask for that many computers."</p>
<p>Emily: "Don't you think that under-privileges girls?"</p>
<p>Asheesh: "I don't see why it would."</p>
<p>Emily: "It's an empirical question. Girls are under-represented on school rosters in much of the developing world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Huh</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Emily's remark taught me that the effects of sexism can be magnified if we act unaware of it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I work on <a href="https://openhatch.org/">growing the free software community</a>. What I want is user empowerment.</p>
<p>I spend much of that time organizing <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/scala-crash-course.html">events</a> to <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop">address</a> gender diversity issues in free software. When growing the free software community, it's not enough to find more contributors; we have to make sure we're reaching people of all kinds. Gender is one place where there's still work to be done.</p>
