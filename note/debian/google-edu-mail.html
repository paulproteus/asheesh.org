		<p>Should universities switch away from hosting their own email and join the Google bandwagon?
</p><p><a href="http://stuffthought.tumblr.com/">Adi Kamdar</a> wrote to
the <a href="http://freeculture.org/contact/">Students for Free Culture discussion mailing list</a>
linking us to a
<a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2010/02/09/google-run-yale-e-mail/">Yale Daily News</a>
article discussing an "almost-definite" switch for Yale to Google Apps for Education.
</p><p>Adi asked for thoughts, so here are mine.
</p>
<h2 id="w_privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>One interesting thing about the Gmail option is that, when deployed for 
all students, students have no choice but to let Google read their
official email.
</p><p>Some students might take part in activism that they want to shield from
Google, a corporation with its own interests, or the attackers that
attempt to break into Google's systems (see the recent attacks from
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html">crafty pro-Chinese-government hacktivists</a>).
Before a switch to Gmail, each student could choose if Google was the kind
of company they wanted to share their email with. After a switch to Google Apps, the
choice is made for them.
</p><p>But this highlights a different issue: Before a switch to Google, students
have no choice but to let <i>university administrators</i> read their official
email. That's not necessarily optimal, either. Others have pointed out in
this thread that this option comes with legal advantages with regard to
privacy law. At least that's some consolation.
</p><p>It's still true that students can encrypt their email and make it
difficult for <i>any</i> eavesdropper to figure out the bodies of their emails.
But that's no use for hiding the identities of the people with whom they
communicate -- no email crypto I know hides email addresses.
</p>
<h2 id="w_software-freedom-and-open-standards">Software freedom and open standards</h2>
<p>This is juxtaposed against another difficult situation: Matt Senate wrote
about the sucky Squirrelmail system that Berkeley uses (used?) for
webmail. The fact that SquirrelMail is Free Software is small consolation
for Matt. From his perspective, because it's a hosted web application, he
has no more freedom than he would have with Gmail.
</p><p>At least Berkeley's IMAP server followed standards! That's more than we  
can say for the Gmail IMAP server, which is famous for basically
supporting just enough IMAP for Microsoft Outlook to work.
</p><p>But standards compliance is small consolation. If the university email
server "properly" supports IMAP, but isn't <i>fast</i> or doesn't provide the
new extensions that make threading or search speedy, it's not much relief 
to know that you can use any client you want to slowly read your email.
</p>
<h2 id="w_internet-history">Internet history</h2>
<p>Truth be told, University-hosted Internet services are based on what you
might call the original Internet perspective. The Internet began as a
network of networks. A University was a network island unto itself,
running its own email, news, and Ethernet services. When inter-network
connection was available, you can email people at other institutions. When
it wasn't, well -- the Internet is a useful tool, but it's down
right now. "Don't worry," the admins might tell you,
"you can still read your email with PINE."
</p><p>It used to be that inter-network connectivity was icing on top of the
"real" network a person used.
</p><p>Today, inter-network connectivity is the whole <i>point</i> of a network
connection. How embarrassing for each individual network! To test if our
connections are working, we skip right over the local content and point
our web browsers at a search engine. 
</p><p>Users today aren't satisfied to read their email from imap.institution.edu
and read USENET news-- they thirst for real-time access resources
available beyond the university. Students weren't interested in
the J-Stream service I helped set up at Johns Hopkins; instead they mostly
posted and watched videos at YouTube. They don't really care if the the
student-oriented wiki is based on campus or instead halfway across the
globe (say, in Japan).
</p><p>The original Internet was based on autonomous networks and opt-in routing.
But eventually, all the networks opted in. Users drive everything, and  
when they don't get what they want, they vote with their feet. Companies
like Facebook and Google stand ready and armed to provide
shockingly-efficient services to millions of users who choose them. You
could say that with today's network, the autonomy shifted from the
<i>network</i> to the <i>users</i>.
</p><p>The nice thing about University-run services is that students can organize
and ask for changes, as Fred pointed out. And for people like me, there's
something nice about knowing the person who runs your email system.
</p><p>But if your busy university staff doesn't have time to investigate an
email server with fast full-text indexing, you might wish for change.
Having the university tear down its internal services is a progression
toward seeing its network as simply <i>transit</i>.
</p><p>Imagine the loss of pride. It used to be that the university personally  
ran a system for helping users get what they wanted. As it becomes simply
transit, the staff are just greasing the cogs of a larger, invisible
machine that's easy for users take for granted.
</p><p>Some netizens like me hold email as sacred, a beautiful institution based
on standards and a decision to interoperate. When your university switches
to Gmail, I'll be sadder, but maybe what you'll get is professors who can 
spend more time with students and less time configuring desktop software. 
</p>
<h2 id="w_trade-offs">Trade offs</h2>
<p>Every university has a choice: Pay hundreds of thousands to millions of
dollars a year for dedicated staff to run an in-house email system, or let
Google do it. Think for a moment of what good could come from those
dollars when put to use in other ways for students.
</p><p>Your school could start a switch to all-organic food. It could start
paying more of its employees a living wage. Imagine the travel funding for
student activities that can come from hundreds of thousands a year
well-spent. It could run a massive used textbook clearinghouse to help   
students avoid pouring their dollars into the textbook industry.  
</p><p>And now cry with me. What I've asked you do is to consider sacrificing   
institutional autonomy for cold, hard cash. That's to say nothing of the
ecological benefits or the productivity increases possible from having
Google's paid experts run this part of the computing system.
</p>
<h2 id="w_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Is an official Google email system much different than the reality most
students I know live, which is configuring their student email address to
forward to gmail.com?
</p><p>For those of us who would be sadder with one more push toward centralizing
email with Google -- for those who see it as the behemoth whose size
threatens the decentralization that used to be the core of the Internet --
I ask you to think positive. "See the profit from your loss."
</p><p>I have no conclusions for you, just niggling questions.
