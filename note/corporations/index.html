        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/corporations/illegal-takedowns.html">Computer fraud and abuse by Universal Music Group
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>It seems that Universal Music Group
willfully misrepresented its copyright interest and probably
violated its service contract with YouTube. By my understanding
of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, UMG likely took actions
that <a href="http://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act_%28CFAA%29">exceed authorized access</a>,
subjecting it to criminal prosecution. (I am just a computer enthusiast
and not a lawyer, so I welcome corrections from others.)
</p><p>The emerging details, reported by Wired.com's Threat Level blog,
are <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/youtube-universal-megaupload/">as follows</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>YouTube said Friday that Universal Music abused the video-sharing site’s piracy filters when it employed them to take down a controversial video of celebrities and pop superstars singing and praising the notorious file-sharing service Megaupload.</blockquote>
<p>In particular, Google created a system for antipiracy that is being abused
by UMG:
</p>
<blockquote>“Our partners do not have the right to take down videos from YT unless they own the rights to them or they are live performances controlled through exclusive agreements with their artists, which is why we reinstated it,” Google-owned YouTube said.</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to a speedy criminal prosecution of the employees
or board of Universal Music Group. If that is not feasible,
perhaps the organization itself should be
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/corporations/behind-bars-draft.html">put behind bars</a>.
</p><p>Even if Megaupload.com fails in its own lawsuit against UMG,
I eagerly await the criminal prosecution of UMG as in
<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/swartz-arrest/">another case where Federal prosecutors had to get involved</a>.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/corporations/behind-bars-draft.html">How To Put Corporations in Jail and Prison (draft)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>In the U.S., some crimes carry jail or prison terms for the persons who commit them. Some of the persons
who commit these crimes are so-called "natural persons" -- people like you and me. Some of them
are corporations. This brief essay explains how and why to apply prison sentences to these artificial persons.
</p><p>I am not a lawyer. I do live in a country with laws, and I worry that these "artificial persons" can skirt
the law by being structured to avoid jail time. So I propose this draft, and I am interested in feedback.
</p>
<h3 id="w_1-a-brief-summary-of-jail-and-prison">1. A brief summary of jail and prison</h3>
<p>First, let us review life for natural persons when they are convicted of a crime with a prison term.
Prisoners may find themselves in a minimum-security institution, where they are given some small
degree of autonomy, limited (but non-zero) access to communication systems like postal mail,
telephones, and in-person visits, and are put to work. Persons who commit violent crimes and constitute
a risk to other inmates may be incarcerated in a medium- or high-security facility; in these,
inmates are carefully tracked and intensive barriers and check-points prevent too-great movement.
</p><p>It can be disruptive for a person to find himself or herself behind bars, but it is a disruption
that the legal system is willing to make so that the public can enjoy a law-abiding society.
</p><p>Life in prisons is still <i>life</i>: inmates may always eat, drink water, think to
themselves, and (as far as I know) make written notes to themselves. Many famous activists have spent
time in jail or prison and gone on to continue their careers. Prisoners in low-security
facilities may enjoy lots of communication with other persons, so long as it does not require
the use of communication technology.
</p><p>Persons spending time in prison may continue to own property outside of the prison.
Their ability to use it while incarcerated is minimal to nonexistent, but they may have bank accounts,
investments, or other financial instruments that appreciate in value.
</p>
<h3 id="w_2-how-the-structure-of-corporations-makes-law-enforcement-harder">2. How the structure of corporations makes law enforcement harder</h3>
<p>Now that we have a concept of what prison is like, let us carefully consider what it means to
be a corporation. Corporations are legal constructions, created to
achieve a specific end. They have a primary place of business where individual natural persons meet
to do work to help the corporation achieve those ends. Most corporations are created for the
private profit of their founders.
</p><p>The corporation is, fundamentally, a legally-approved
veil over the collective activity of individual persons.
This corporate veil limits the <i>financial</i> liability for its Directors; if the corporation owes
rent on its property, for example, the Directors are not responsible personally for this debt.
Virtually all actions of corporations are about the transfer of money. The existence of
this structure is widely-considered a good, efficient thing.
</p><p>Some actions of a corporation go beyond the transfer of money; some actions are criminal.
At the moment, individual natural persons who commit crimes as part of their
duties to the corporation may find themselves in court and possibly in jail. This can
flow all the way up the chain to the Directors.
</p><p>But if an employee is asked by her manager to commit a crime for the private
inurement of the corporation, she is the one most at-risk for criminal proceedings.
If a corporation profits from check fraud, the fines may be smaller than the profits
earned.
</p><p>The incentives are mis-aligned: if an investor calculates that the financial punishment for
breaking the law will not hurt the corporation, he might urge the corporation to flout
the law. The result might be dramatically increased profits with a side-effect of
an employee or a Director in jail.
</p><p>There is an elegant solution to this problem: when an agent for the corporation commits a
crime with a jail term, the corporation should spend some time incarcerated as well.
This brings us to the final part: the mechanics of applying jail and prison terms to
corporations.
</p>
<h3 id="w_3-how-to-put-companies-behind-bars">3. How to put companies behind bars</h3>
<p>Rather than painstakingly identify the employees most responsible for lawbreaking
within a corporation, it may be simpler to put the corporation behind bars.
Practically speaking, this means moving the primary place of business of the
corporation to a jail or prison.
</p><p>In this regime, when a company is in jail, the employees must go to the jail
and subject themselves to the standard restrictions of the jail as they go about
their business. If the company has committed a violent offense (perhaps
the calculated murder of citizens who live near its place of toxic waste dumping),
then while employees are contributing their time to the corporation, they
would be subject to highly-secured perimeter fences and close supervision.
</p><p>Just like a natural person, the corporation can continue its life while in prison.
It may have limited access to communication technology, but (depending on
the security level of the facility) employees will be able to take notes
on paper, send checks in the mail, plan the corporation's future actions, and possibly
attend meetings with each other. If this is not enough to maintain the
corporation's activities, it should have considered that before committing
criminal acts.
</p><p>One downside to this system is that as corporations are increasingly convicted
of crimes, their employees could fill up our already-stretched prison capacity.
This, and other practical problems, are easy to address if you consider the
spirit of this proposal. The restrictions of prison life could be applied by
sending jail wardens to corporate headquarters, where employees are scrutinized
and restricted under the same rules as they would be in prison. The warden
can be responsible for ensuring limits on communication technology use are
enforced.
</p><p>It can be disruptive for a corporation to find itself
behind bars, but it is a disruption
that the legal system should be willing to make so that the public can enjoy a law-abiding society.

       </h1>
		
<p>Interesting tidbit at the Washington Post about l33t 4dwarez h4x0r <a 
href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/11/security_pro_admits_to_hijacki.html?nav=rss_blog">pleading 
guilty</a> to being malicious:</p>

<blockquote>
John Kenneth Schiefer, 26, variously known online as "acid" and 
"acidstorm," agreed to plead guilty to at least four felony charges of 
fraud and wiretapping, charges punishable by $1.75 million in fines and 
nearly 60 years in prison.
</blockquote>

<p>That was for for 250,000 computers.  When the evidence is laid out 
against people at AT&T, if the evidence says they defrauded and 
wiretapped at least 100 times that many people, what will their 
punishment be?</p>

<p>I'm rooting for 60 * 100 years in jail, spread evenly among the 
people who did the wiretapping.  Or perhaps 60 * 100 years for each 
person, if that seems more fair.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/corporations/hope.html">I don't worry, I hope</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>AT&T has been "allegedly" <a 
href="http://www.eff.org/cases/att">illegally wiretapping Americans for 
ages and giving that data illegally to the government</a>.  Here's the 
government's take:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/washington/23nsa.html?hp">
The companies face suits from customers who say their privacy was 
violated. Administration officials say they worry that the suits, 
pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 
could bankrupt the utilities.
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't "worry" they could bankrupt the utilities.  I 
<strong>hope</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is no incentive for these corporations, and others in a long 
line past them, to follow the law, then we no longer have the rule of 
law: companies will simply do illegal things and then explain that if 
the law were enforced, they'd have to pay some money.</p>

<p>I've been screaming and swearing about this for a week.  I can't 
understand how anyone can calmly disagree with this.</p>

<p>Let me remind you that the President, who is charge of the executive 
branch of government in this country, "shall take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed" according to the <a
