<h3>Creative Commons needs someone good. If not me, then who? (2006)</h3>

<p>At the end of 2006, graduation was looming. I had to find a job.</p>

<p>The Johns Hopkins CS jobs emails seemed to list two kinds of work in the Baltimore
area: cutting-edge artificial intelligence research to build better killing machines
for defense contractors, and mind-numbing Java development jobs that
built expensive, hard-to-use websites for government agencies.</p>

<p>Faced with these options, I thought I'd ask Creative Commons if they wanted
to hire a software engineer. (I had just interned there the summer of 2006.) To my
glee and relief, they said, "Yes." In the blink of an eye, I said "Yes" back.</p>

<p>Then Google recruiters started emailing me. They suggested I apply to be
a Site Reliability Engineer. They needed people who
understood Linux-based performance issues and software architecture, could
critique other engineers' designs before they took code to production, and
be nimble system administrators. That sounded exactly like what I enjoyed doing.
But I told them I already had plans.</p>

<p>While having lunch at Wegmans, I explained this to my parents.</p>

<p>"You could at least <em>interview</em> with them," pleaded my mother.</p>

<p>"No," I explained. "Google has enough resources to find someone who will help it achieve its goals. Creative Commons doesn't necessarily."</p>

<p>The day-to-day work at Google would have been more technically challenging, but
my actions weren't going to make a net difference on the world. At CC, they would.</p>

<h3>My own projects also need that push (2009)</h3>

<p>In late April 2009, I was stunned to
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/move-to-atlanta.html">learn</a> that Shotput Ventures funded
a project Nelson, Raffi, and I applied to start. It's now called <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>.</p>

<p>I had started working at Creative Commons because I wanted to push the world in that direction.
I had enough self-confidence to think that if it wasn't me coding for them (and promoting them),
it could be someone less effective.</p>

<p>In 2009, I realized that the same applied to my own projects. If there is a direction I want to
push the world, it's not going that way unless <em>I</em> push it.</p>

<p>Thus was one more layer of humility removed.</p>

<h3>This job will teach me skills I want -- on their time (2011)</h3>

<p>Recently, I've considered other ways to spend my time: for example, building a system administration co-op to 
combat corporate cloud services with freedom-loving humans, or organizing urban kitchens for hungry 
yuppies to practice cooking during their lunch breaks.</p>

<p>To understand how to make the sysadmin co-op succeed,
I needed to understand devops-style system automation tools. A few months ago, while working on
<a href="http://mirocommunity.org/">Miro Community</a>, I had the chance to redefine the service requirements
using <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/introduction/">Puppet</a>. Once I realized that it would
help me plan my own future, I lept at the task.</p>

<p>This year, it struck me that if a job can teach me something I want to know in order to
make my own projects succeed better, <em>that</em> could be a reason to take it. That includes
future projects, and goals with a timeline of 5-10 years.</p>

<p>Until recently, I thought
that jobs were devices for turning my time into some change in the world; I didn't realize I could
retain some of the value in the transaction.
In other words, I realized that I'm not an invisible worker pushing the world around. I'm a 
permanent fixture in my life.</p>

<p>Thus was removed one layer of self-effacement.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'll conclude with some advice to myself:</p>

<p>Don't forget about yourself. Not just your vision of the world; things like, What skills are you gaining? How does this job help you succeed at what you'll be doing five years from now?</p>
