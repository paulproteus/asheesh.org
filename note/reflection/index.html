        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/reflection/important-problems.html">Work on important problems
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>A friend pointed me to a
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">transcript</a>
of Richard Hamming's motivational
speech, "You and your research." In the speech, Hamming (the famous inventor of
the Hamming code, an early and vital error-correction algorithm) discusses points
that make a researcher generate <i>important</i> results for the field. (<strike>I think it was Blake who sent me the link.</strike> I seem to have no idea how I found it initially.)
</p><p>I'll now take a moment and mis-quote Hamming, pretending he's giving advice to activists rather
than scientists:
</p>
<blockquote>
If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work. It’s
perfectly obvious. Great activists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of
important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack
them. Let me warn you, ‘important problem’ must be phrased carefully. The three
outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at
Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you
want to mention. We didn’t work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity.
They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It’s not the
consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.
That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most activists don’t work on
important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average activist, so far as I can make
out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be
important and he also doesn’t believe that they will lead to important problems.
</blockquote>
<p>He tells great stories, and you should read the transcript. Here, however,
is a summary of his points:
</p>
<ul><li> A handful of people do excellent science repeatedly. It does not boil down to pure luck (though luck does remain important). Courage and hard-work are huge factors.
</li><li> As you grow older, you will be tempted to only work on large problems. Instead, Shannon urges us to "continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow."
</li><li> Necessity is the mother of invention. When you have a resource constraint, you will be forced to address it, perhaps in a novel and generally-useful way.
</li><li> Be committed to your research question, not your current results. Take note of the places where your data disagree with your theory. You'll need those places later.
</li><li> When you see a good attack, drop everything and focus on it until you find out if it will work.
</li><li> If you work with your office as an open door, within a decade you will know where the field has moved-to in a way that closed-door workers will not.
</li><li> When solving a problem, consider how it can be "characteristic of a class" of problem rather than just one isolated problem.
</li><li> You must become good at presenting ("selling") your work as well as your motivations.
</li><li> Avoid the personality defect of wanting total control. This prevents other people from helping you. Generally, learn how to use the system. That includes being willing to <i>appear to conform</i>.
</li><li> Avoid the personality defect of excessive ego assertion. "Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first−class science?"
</li><li> Gain the personality boon of seeing the positive side of things, even constraints. Especially self-set constraints.
</li><li> Know thyself.
</li></ul>
<p>The Q&A, and the full speech, get the blood pumping. <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">Give it a read</a>.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/reflection/2008-belated.html">2008, in summary
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Here's an old bit of text that, for some reason, I never posted. It's a review of 2008, from the perspective of Asheesh on the first Saturday night in 2009.
</p><p>There are some thoughts in here that I had trouble recognizing. Here are some notes that might help you understand what I was talking about:
</p>
<ul><li> In May 2007, I graduated from <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>, having spent nearly five full years in Baltimore. In July 2007, I moved to San Francisco to start working at Creative Commons.
</li><li> "<b>a new metric</b>": This refers to the <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/joy-drain.html">joy-drain calculus</a>.
</li><li> The teaching I began in 2008 was the Python class I helped Seth with, to EFF employees, and then the Noisebridge/SF-LUG "PYCLASS" that I started all by myself. (This class is continuing in my absence!)
</li><li> The visions of my future self, then, were as a computer science student pushing the field forward and pulling policymakers closer to us. I imagined working with Ed Felten and his Center for Information Technology Policy program at Princeton. I also applied to MIT's Decentralized Information Group. Neither program accepted me. Going forward, the next step would be working with security researchers to get published, but I seem to be busy right now with <a href="http://openhatch.org/">something else</a>.
</li><li> Things I did that were pretty unthinkable to me a few years back: Abstractly speaking, one has to do with minimizing jealousy; the other has to do with causing it.
</li></ul>
<p>Somehow this 2008 restrospective fails to mention probably the singularly best thing I did in 2008: I went to Debconf.
</p><p>And now, some writing from a year and a half ago.
</p><p>8----&lt; CUT HERE &gt;---8
</p><p><b>Two thousand eight</b>
</p><p>"Saturating the metrics."
</p><p>Toward the end of 2007 I was worried I had run out of ambitions. All the things I could have named in 2006 that I would 
have said I wanted, I already had, or I had a clear path to getting. Thinking through it at the time, the list didn't 
even seem very long.
</p><p>You could say that from the summer of 2001 up to the middle of 2007, my path was obvious. I would graduate from high 
school, and I would go to college. I would keep some old friends, and I would have great difficulty with the increasing 
distance between me and some of them.  I would eschew proprietary software. I would be whimsical and earnest, if 
sometimes melodramatic. I would graduate again and again. I would be in a safe, understandable environment that would 
provide me outlets for all these things.
</p><p>Getting out of school takes away that last one. It also takes away a peer group, replacing it with a nebulous concept of 
friends who suddenly aren't all in the same place of life as you.
</p><p>"No one's watching"
</p><p>Around Halloween 2007, I said I felt like no one's watching me. My friends for years aren't around to see what I'm doing, 
and to tell me if I'm crazy or wrong. All they get to hear is what I tell them. If I don't say what is wrong when they 
ask, they'll never know to ask again. They won't be surprised at who they see me walking around with because they'll 
never see me walking around here. "Watching" meant "watching out," like a big brother but not like Big Brother.
</p><p>That was 2007. In 2008, there still aren't people who see me every single day who know me well enough to tell me firmly 
that I'm doing something I should not be. But I don't feel the same sort of loneliness as I did a year before. A few 
really close friends can make a world of a difference for me. I now know enough people here whose struggles and character 
strengths and flaws are familiar to me; I trust them enough that I'm eager to have mine become familiar to them. It helps 
that I really believe that these people care about me; it also helps that I think I can see that care in people. They 
want to know what I'm doing, and they can help me find out how I feel about it. I guess I've learned to smooth over the 
temporal distance between conversations even with close friends.
</p><p>One of those people scared me when she told me she might leave San Francisco. I was saddened, and I wanted to tell her 
all the things I'd miss about her. Before I got a chance to tell her, as I thought about them, I found that I had a lot 
of the characteristics I liked in her. I guess I really like me, and I would sure miss me if for some reason I found 
myself missing.
</p><p>By the middle of the year, I came up with a new metric: not for me, but for my relationships with other people. How much 
joy do I get, like by sharing a smile or a sigh? And how much does the person drain me, like from the anxiety of waiting 
or by our repeated failures to communicate? What a perfect year in which to suddenly lose a particular neediness that 
haunted one friendship.
</p><p>"They try what they're not"
</p><p>There were a couple of things that I did this past year that would have seemed pretty unthinkable to me a few years back. 
One I tried and found it was much more painful than I thought; that taught me a lot. The other was less painful than I 
had expected, and the absence of pain taught me a different sort of terror. In the end, neither of them showed me I was 
someone fundamentally different than who I thought I was, but that certainly wasn't the only possible outcome. Somehow 
these self-experiments of 2008 touched me a lot more deeply than the ones in 2007.
</p><p>"Anything"
</p><p>The other sensation I had a year and a half ago, just as I left college to start working, was, "I could do 
<b>anything</b>." It was overhwelming; suddenly out of college, there was nothing to bind me to anything at all. I could 
program computers, or I could sell ice cream. The realization came to me as a reflection of learning that while Lawrence 
Lessig could keep informing the world about copyright, he would ditch that success entirely and start a new crusade.
</p><p>The overwhelming thing was how empty "anything" was. Let alone a better idea; I couldn't really come up with anything I 
wanted to do other than what I had been doing. I can still keep sliding forward, I knew, but I felt unprepared to 
<b>decide</b> what I would do next.
</p><p>In 2008, I remembered that I like teaching people. I think I should do that more, perhaps in a professional setting. And 
I have a few ideas for visions of my future self; they require the cooperation of others, so we'll see what they say. But 
I've seen the visions with enough clarity to know who to ask, so now I'm waiting on something concrete. And rather than 
just squint at the hazy distant future, some friends helped me gain the self-confidence to apply that to this moment: Of 
<b>course</b> I should try to teach ninth graders about copyright and Creative Commons. Of course I should try to speak to 
the anarchists of Baltimore about it, and (this one finally my own idea) of course I should give a tutorial at the yearly 
PyCon.
</p><p>Suddenly present this year is a sense that I feel comfortable in my skin. I'm really grateful that some of my friends 
seem to have found that for themselves this year, too.

</a>
       </h1>
		<h3 id="w_what-went-well-in-2007">What went well in 2007</h3>
<ul><li> I have a job working to advance a cause I believe in.
</li><li> I have a fairly nice server being treated to love and pampering.
</li><li> I'm living in a nice slice of a house with an awesome roommate.
</li><li> I've settled on some asheesh.org tech that I seem to be interested in actually using.
</li><li> Since taking over the tech for Students for Free Culture, I've been fairly responsible and reliable.  (Certainly when compared to our previous experiences.)
</li><li> I (still) have good friends.
</li><li> I seem to have adequate social skills.
</li><li> I've been consistently uploading packages (through a sponsor) to the Debian archive, and I now have Debian Maintainer status.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_what-went-poorly">What went poorly</h3>
<ul><li> I still am not using a phone running only Free Software for everyday use.
</li><li> The asheesh.org tech is quite barebones - no comments, no photos, no artificially-creative automatic free-association.
</li><li> I'm still only "nearly" using full-text search on IMAP.
</li><li> I lost freaking gobs of data in a massive disk crash.
</li><li> I still don't have quick automatic easy access to all the songs I own.
</li><li> My computers still don't do everything I want them to in the blink of an eye without me even asking, and all my computers aren't connected to each other with wireless gigabit links.
</li><li> I'm still afraid of voicemail and of calling some people.
</li><li> My bedroom has been a disaster zone.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_what-i-didnt-guess-would-happen">What I didn't guess would happen</h3>
<ul><li> Gaurav seems to be using Ubuntu and enjoying Compiz Fusion.
</li><li> Apple launched DRM-free music on their iTunes store.
</li><li> I ran into #joiitoers at least twice by accident.
</li><li> I went to Burning Man, and learned that I think I prefer the Mystery Hunt.
</li><li> I sat on a terrace in Croatia and drank Absynthe (I know, the boring legal-in-Germany kind).
</li><li> I went to Tokyo to present about the Semantic Web (and Neurocommons) to a room full of people twice my age.  While in town, I struck up a conversation in French with some Swiss dudes.
</li><li> I looked at myself in a mirror on two separate occasions, and realized that getting a haircut looked <b>really</b> good, and also that torn sneakers look like someone sticking his tongue out.
</li></ul>
<p>I wonder what 2008 will be like.
