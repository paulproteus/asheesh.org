</a>
       </h1>
		<p>"<a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/tutorials/larioa_web/">Scrape the Web</a>,"
my PyCon tutorial on web scraping is back this year! Plus I'll be leading
a conversation on how to get involved with Free Software from my
poster at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/posters/">the poster session</a>.
</p><p>This year's Python conference takes place February 19-21 in Atlanta, 
Georgia, USA.
</p>
<h3 id="w_poster-session">Poster session</h3>
<p>This year is the first year PyCon is holding a poster session. My poster 
is on open source and Free Software for the Python community, focusing on how
you can get involved.
</p><p>It's a plenery session. This means, for 90 minutes, there will be a 
dozen of us presenters standing in front of our posters hoping PyCon attendees will
talk to us. Everyone at PyCon will be 
milling about, since there will be no talks during the poster session.
So stop by!
</p>
<h3 id="w_web-scraping-tutorial">Web scraping tutorial</h3>
<p>I had lots of fun
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon09-scraping-fun.html">last year</a>
talking to a packed room about programming the web. The World-Wide Web
is the world's most widely-used distributed computing system; if you're only
using it from a web browser, you're missing out. It's a tutorial, which is
a paid three-hour course (with refreshments) in a classroom setting. Based
on what last year's attendees said afterward at lunch, it seemed the
attendees enjoyed themselves too!
</p><p>From Python, there's a host of choices for pulling information from the 
web, and a few choices for pushing data back (usually through forms). Here
are some topics we'll cover:
</p>
<ul><li> The sorry (if humorous) state of standards on the web
</li><li> Evaluating web page parsing engines
</li><li> Why you don't want to use regular expresions (and how you can anyway)
</li><li> Submitting to forms
</li></ul>
<p>I think the most exciting part is the discussion of getting around 
anti-scraping countermeasures. This is where the rubber hits the road. 
We'll:
</p>
<ul><li> Write Python code that automatically submits comments to a WordPress blog protected by <a href="http://wordpress-plugins.feifei.us/hashcash/">WP Hashcash</a>
</li><li> Choose a user-agent so Google doesn't block us immediately
</li><li> Look at deployed software that has built-in CAPTCHA solving
</li><li> Compare the effectiveness of different countermeasures
</li><li> Automate a completely AJAX website by mechanizing Firefox itself
</li></ul>
<p>Last year's version is <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2022154/">online as a video</a>.
If you missed it last year, 
<a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/registration/">register for PyCon</a>
and sign up for my tutorial, "Scrape the Web." You're likely to learn a lot,
and I'm always happy to answer questions during and afterward.

		<p><a href="http://likearadiotelescope.wordpress.com/">Lisa</a> pointed me to a
<i>Science News</i>
<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/50522/title/Depression_medication_may_offer_mood_lift_via_personality_shift">article</a> discussing Paxil, a medicine prescribed for depression.
The important bit:
</p>
<blockquote>
“We propose that modern antidepressants work partly by correcting the long-term personality risk factors for depression,” Tang says.
</blockquote>
<p>The 
<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/50522/title/Depression_medication_may_offer_mood_lift_via_personality_shift">article</a>
explains that, even after
"accounting for the extent to which each treatment diminished standard measures of depression," taking Paxil makes you less neurotic and less introverted.
</p><p>Recently we learned that
<a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/drugs/magazine/17-09/ff_placebo_effect?currentPage=all">the placebo effect is getting stronger</a>.
What this research makes me wonder is, If we helped these people adjust these personality traits via e.g. cognitive therapy, and then gave them placebo, would they have the same high success in defeating depression as the Paxil takers?
</p><p>Please understand that I do believe the lived experience of depressed people is terrible.
I don't mean to diminish their suffering.
I'm wondering here about ways how we can help people be happier.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">Diversity in Free Software: South Asians as an example
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>As someone born in India, I sometimes look around and wonder, Where are the
Indians (and other South Asians) in Free Software?
</p><p>(I don't mean to exclude South Asians from other countries, so I will lump
us together. I believe that we are more similar than we are different,
although I know more about India than about the rest of South Asia.)
</p><p>There is no shortage of Indians performing information technology jobs 
in the United States. The same is true in academia; the Computing 
Research Association uses National Science Foundation data to show
<a href="http://www.cra.org/info/education/us/bs.ethnicity.html">about 15% of computer science bacholor's degrees</a>
are awarded to "Asians or Pacific 
Islanders." These are not precise numbers targeted at South Asians in 
particular, but they confirm a general feeling that plenty of 
technologists in the United States are from that part of the world.
</p><p>South Asia is quite a populous region, coming in at over one billion people.
It, too, has plenty of technology workers. So much FLOSS conversation happens
in English, and India is well-suited to handle this; English is an
"<a href="http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/preseng.htm">official language</a>".
Indian academia <a href="http://tesol-india.ac.in/EnglishTeachingIndustry/en/india-worlds-second-largest-english-speaking-country">reports</a>
that there are 350 million English users and about 90 million English speakers.
</p><p>So let's visually compare
<a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/developers.loc">the Debian developers map</a>
for South Asia (over one billion people) and that of New Zealand, a country of four million.
</p><p>India:
</p><p><img src="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/dd-maps/debian-in-india.png" height="96" width="72" />
</p><p>New Zealand:
</p><p><img src="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/dd-maps/debian-in-new-zealand.png" height="67" width="38" />
</p><p>These two countries have about the same number of Debian developers (at 
least, who have marked their location in the Debian LDAP database). About
<b>four</b>.
</p><p>South Asians comprise about one sixth of the world's population. There are
about one thousand Debian developers; we represent at best 1% of that. These
numbers are comparable to the under-representation of women in Free Software,
especially when you compare the figure to South Asians' <i>over-representation</i>
in the rest of information technology.
</p><p>That makes me sad.
</p><p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/developers.loc">the Debian developer map again</a>.
You'll see that Debian is certainly <i>not</i> an Americans-only project, or even an
English-speakers-only project. South America has a respectable dotting of developers,
and Western- to Central-Europe are packed.
</p><p>I have strong feelings about Free Software. It emerges from an ethos of personal
empowerment, and with open source it has become a dominant force in computing.
Yet there are plenty of sharp people -- at least women and South Asians --
who, somehow, become culturally excluded from participating.
</p>
<h3 id="w_why-care-about-diversity">Why care about diversity?</h3>
<p>Consider the diversity of contributors we already have.
Some contribute to Free Software because of particular business needs, such as what caused
<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/8088">Avi Kivity to write KVM</a>, the new leader in Linux-based
virtualization.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everaldo_Coelho">Everaldo</a>'s art background
gave us the "Crystal" icon set that set the standard for sharp-looking icons on the Free
Desktop for years.
<a href="http://lists.annodex.net/pipermail/flac-dev/2001-September/000457.html">Josh Coalson</a>
knew about compressing sound, and his Free Lossless Audio
Codec is now the standard in high quality audio.
</p><p>We already have a great deal of diversity. We should be celebrating!
</p><p>Back in 2001, FLAC's users <i>were</i> celebrating. In that year, I decided to ditch proprietary operating
systems
because I felt I could achieve all my computing needs in the Free world. A happy user of FLAC
myself, 
I lurked on the mailing list as I
<a href="http://lists.annodex.net/pipermail/flac-dev/2001-September/000457.html">watched</a> grateful people
thank Josh for the great software he wrote.
</p><p>Different contributions will excite different sorts of users. The more different people we 
have improving FLOSS, the more happy users we can make. Happy users of FLOSS are Free users.
Happy users can become contributors, putting forth code, documentation, translations,
and word-of-mouth marketing.
</p><p>The first reason to improve diversity in FLOSS is to better suit our users' needs. The more 
diversity we have in our contributors, the more chance we have of tickling our users in the 
ways that please them the most. I wish to see an end to software that restricts users' 
freedom, so I want to see us build the tools that users want.
</p><p>One thing that pleases me is when I see other people contributing who seem similar to me. 
When I went to Debconf, I was thrilled to be surrounded by people who cared about software 
freedom and technical excellence. I had even more fun being social, chatting about 
rainforests, mutual friends, websites, and music. I might have had the <i>most</i> fun playing 
the card game Mao.
</p><p>A second reason, then, to improve diversity in FLOSS is to increase contributor retention 
by increasing joy. Mao was an example of a cultural bond I happened to share with a 
handful of Debianites. The more diversity we have, the more frequent these sorts of 
coincidences will be.
</p><p>The final, most obvious, reason to reach out to groups of people who do not typically 
contribute is that we can <i>increase our numbers</i>. That by itself is so valuable. Ubuntu 
sees <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad/Observations">100 new bugs per week</a>, even after
the bug squad's efforts.
If we can do a better job of recruiting new contributors, the raw <i>numbers</i> give us
more strength in creating and maintaining world-class software as well as letting the
world know about it.
</p>
<h3 id="w_changing-the-balance">Changing the balance</h3>
<p>I believe that there are plenty of South Asians quite capable of contributing to FLOSS. I 
believe the same of women. I believe the same of men.
</p><p>Back to the topic at hand. Why do the South Asians vanish when we look at Free Software, not
tech in general?
</p><p>There are plenty of reasons I can dream up, based on my experience with Indians.
</p>
<ul><li> Plenty of South Asian parents urge their children to make low-risk career choices.
</li><li> My mother reports that schools in India focus on memorization instead of creativity. This can leave little room for extracurricular pursuits.
</li></ul>
<p>It's tough for FLOSS advocates to work directly on these distant issues. But I think we
can focus some problems we <i>can</i> help solve. Crucially, <i>awareness</i> of Free Software
spreads best by social circles. I learned about Linux from a friend at a summer camp.
I'll repeat that:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>Awareness</i> of Free Software spreads best by social networks.
</li></ul>
<p>So if you want to spread that awareness, try to be a bridge.
</p><p>If you meet someone from an unusual background for open source who needs support or 
mentorship, try to help. That is an investment in the diversity and growth of Free 
Software. Those people can now unlock more "open source minorities."
</p>
<h3 id="w_what-success-looks-like">What success looks like</h3>
<p>Google Summer of Code helps some new contributors get started and provides that mentorship. 
Rachel McCreary was invited to the SciPy conference 
<a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/12/summer-of-coders-at-scipy-rachel.html">after a successful summer</a>.
Her father left a comment explaining how her sisters participated in FLOSS via Google's
Highly Open Participation (GHOP) Contest:
</p>
<blockquote>
Rachel was inspired and motivated by BOTH of her little sisters, each completing six GHOP tasks (if memory serves).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
GHOP and GSOC has been a game-changer for these girls. Rachel's younger sister is applying to schools such as MIT with an interest in a science major. The youngest daughter now has a Caltech poster on her wall with the intent to eventually attend.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Their proud Dad
</blockquote>
<p>Soon, these stories will be commonplace. Until then, we have work to do.
</p><p>(I'm still researching these topics. If you can help me find any sort of data to help me
learn more about diversity in FLOSS, even if it seems like I wouldn't like it,
leave a comment.)

       </h1>
		<p>A couple of weeks ago,
Lucas Nussbaum <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=408">wrote about his experience</a> at the Ubuntu Developer Summit.
Two things stuck out at me:
</p>
<ul><li> "Ubuntu has clearly gone a very long way since 2004. Everything looks very well organized and polished, and gives the impression of a big machine that nothing can stop."
</li></ul>
<p>In the summer of 2004, my laptop (an iBook G4) ran Debian GNU/Linux on PowerPC. I tried out Ubuntu that autumn, and was very impressed.
It's been five years since then. My desktop still runs Debian, and I'm proud to be a "two-distro" community member.
</p><p>At the same time, this juggernaut nature raises concern. When Ubuntu releases ship with significant flaws, I quietly sigh and wonder,
Are we doing good service to the people coming to GNU/Linux for the first time and seeing Ubuntu? This bugginess has bit me a few times (even
for upgrades between one release and the next), and it pushed a friend of mine to switch a lot of his computing to DragonflyBSD.
</p><p>Lucas points out that Ubuntu's done a <i>fantastic</i> job of becoming visible.
A <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=ubuntu,linux,debian,gnu">look at Google Trends</a> shows that people search for
"Ubuntu" about as much as they search for "Linux" at all.
</p><p>Richard Stallman complains when people refer to GNU/Linux as just "Linux." But today, the most popular name for an
operating system based on GNU is probably "Ubuntu."
For Stallman, having his hard work associated with someone else's "Linux" project must be frustrating.
As a Debian contributor, it would be easy to succumb to the same feeling with regard to Ubuntu.
</p><p>Lucas is well aware of that. He asks,
</p>
<ul><li> "Will Debian manage to stay relevant, or are we just going to be the technically-pure distro without many users that serves as a package supermarket for Ubuntu?"
</li></ul>
<p>Debian <i>does</i> have users! I was feeling a bit disheartened about my maintenance work on <a href="http://packages.debian.org/alpine">alpine</a> lately,
when out of the blue I received an email from a fellow at MIT asking me if I would accept some help with maintenance from him.
Just seeing the note was a relief; it's very nice to be reminded that I have users to take care of.
</p><p>Debian is not as popular as Ubuntu on the desktop (or laptop), it's true. But technically sharp people do frequently still choose it. For example,
the FreeNAS project recently announced <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/freenas/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=3966&start=0">a switch from FreeBSD to Debian</a>
(and a new name as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/freenas/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=3966&start=0">coreNAS</a>).
</p><p>But we could end up a "package supermarket". To stave this off, we must do good releases and make sure people know about them. Doing all that 
work takes us all time. We must recruit new contributors, help them find things to work on, and make sure they feel welcome. And sometimes-sloppy
maintainers like me ought to fix our packages, and get help from others where necessary.
</p><p>I promise to work toward that.

text in an interactive text editor was unthinkable. It was the hackers

it as a hands-off behind-glass computation resource, was the way of the
