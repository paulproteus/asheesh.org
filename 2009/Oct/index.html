		<p>Today is Monday, October 26. Someone at Yahoo will go home tonight and, on 
the way out, turn off geocities.com.
</p><p><b>Update: Tue, 27 Oct 2009 15:17:50 -0400 Geocities is finally offline.</b> Pages say:
</p>
<blockquote>Sorry, the GeoCities web site you were trying to reach is no longer available.</blockquote>
<p>To commemorate it, I bought <a href="http://geociti.es">geociti.es</a>.
I intend to do what I can to keep 
the Geocities pages on the web. I am part of the 
<a href="http://www.archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a>, an independent group of amateur 
archivists racing to rescue the web from destruction at its own hand.
</p><p>In late 1994, Geocities began offering free web hosting as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocities">Beverly Hills Internet</a>.
A decade ago, Yahoo bought Geocities. In December 1998,
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/264577.stm">one-third of all web users</a>
visited the website. As recently as March 2009,
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/23/AR2009042302542.html">11.5 million unique visitors</a> arrived there.
Today, according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/geocities.com">Alexa Site Info</a>,
Geocities ranks somewhere between the <i>New York Times</i> and
the <i>Washington Post</i> in pageviews. And today, Geocities.com shouts:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">GEOCITIES IS CLOSING ON OCTOBER 26, 2009.</a></blockquote>
<p>Tomorrow, Geocities' website will be closed for good if Yahoo sticks to 
that promise.
</p><p>The amount the Archive Team has downloaded is around one terabyte. That's 
all we seem to be able to reach; many pages were deleted months ago when 
the archiving effort began. The archiving is continuing as I write this.
</p><p>Think of it. Fifteen years of history, memories for millions of people, the 
birth of a generation on the web. More personal embarrassment than all the 
POG games put together. It fits on an $80 piece of storage equipment -- at 
least, that's what we managed to find before Yahoo erases it all.
</p><p>Initially, when I met Jason Scott of the Archive Team, he told me he wanted 
to download Geocities and share it by mailing hard drives around. I told 
him I wanted to hoist it back on the Web. He came around, and we and the rest
of the Archive Team have put Geocities back online.
</p><p><a href="http://geociti.es/">Geociti.es</a> is not the greatest website in the world, no.
This is just a tribute.
</p><p>P.S. Major thanks to <a href="http://johnjosephbachir.org/">John Joseph Bachir</a>
for the paperwork assist.

<h2>Thu, 22 Oct 2009</h2>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/law/craigslist-wins.html">Craigslist is not responsible for users' posting of erotic ads (finally)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Seven months ago, Thomas Dart (Sheriff of Cook County) sued Craigslist, alleging
that Craigslist is liable for illegal sex ads posted by its users. In particular,
he claims that Cragislist's "adult services" section is by definition synonymous
with illegal activity. For that reason, Dart argues, Craigslist should be liable
for illegal posts by its users.
</p><p>To quote Tuesday's ruling by District Court for the Northern District of Illinois:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/10/cook-county-sheriff-loses-case-against-craigslist">Plaintiff is simply wrong</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The ethics of erotic services are, euphemistically, very interesting.
At worst (a situation exacerbated by the underground nature of sex workers), powerful
people pressure or coerce others into serving as their workers. 
Sex trafficking
is a serious problem that ruins lives, and it is heartbreaking to even think about it.
A quick search of the web finds plenty of news stories involving law enforcement finding
sex trafficking operations using Craigslist to sell their victims.
</p><p>These are serious crimes, and they ought to be investigated.
</p><p>Craigslist often stands in the middle of this; in the case of one New York City-based
prostitution ring (not necessarily involved in sex trafficking), Craigslist was
the "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/20/craigslist.prostitution/">sole vehicle through which the company operated</a>".
When Thomas Dart sues Craigslist, one can sympathize with a desire to make it harder
to operate these prostitution rings. When I first heard about this case, I was torn;
I do not relish the forced exploitation of people.
</p><p>A quick look through Philadelphia's "adult services" section finds a lot of
women looking to offer men interactive pornography through web cams. That Craigslist
is a venue for this does not seem particularly dangerous; the same services can
be found by searching the web. Prostitution is (obviously) outlawed by the Cragislist
terms of service, though clearly it can be found there.
</p><p>To return to the story of Thomas Dart, judges must answer legal questions, not necessarily ethical ones.
Craigslist is not a person; it is an automatic web site. Congress wrote a law in 1996 that clarifies
<i>who</i> is publishing these advertisements: the <i>users' of Craigslist, not the service itself.</i>
They are responsible for their actions. 
(You can read more at the Electronic Frontier Foundation's
<a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/230">Guide to Section 230 Legal Protections</a>.)
This definition seems sensible; Craigslist is like a physical bulletin board with clear rules
telling users what to do. As quoted by the EFF, the court wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
Intermediaries are not culpable for "aiding and abetting" their customers who misuse their service to commit unlawful acts.
</blockquote>
<p>This is important; illegal ads for the same illegal services could just as easily have
been posted in a bulletin board supposedly about "Computers and Software". Such a post
would have been abuse, <i>just like illegal posts in Craigslist's adult services section</i>.
This realization helped me come to my personal conclusion about this case: Craigslist, like
a physical bulletin board, ought not to be liable for the actions of its users. Like
a cafe, it is a meeting place. One could stamp out all the overt bulletin boards and
meeting places in the world and create huge harm to our ability to find people we want to
hang out with or do business with and yet <i>still</i> have a world with illegal prostitution.
</p><p>I was relieved to see that the final ruling in this case preserves our ability to have
meeting-places that do not screen the people who enter them for the chance that they will
commit crimes while visiting. I was further relieved to discover that a 1996 portion
of the much-maligned Communications Decency Act codified this years before I started
worrying about it.
</p><p>P.S. Humorously, in the
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/20/craigslist.prostitution/">CNN.com article linked above</a>,
the writer makes the word "pornographic" link directly to http://topics.cnn.com/topics/Internet/.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/sidekick-disaster.html">Microsoft loses all Sidekick users' data. Lesson: Make backups.
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Some tens or hundreds of thousands of T-Mobile USA customers probably
just lost the contacts, photos, and notes "on their phone" forever. Those
data are primarily stored on servers run by Danger, a subsidiary of Microsoft;
rather, they were, until data loss destroyed them.
Many customers' phones do not have a complete copy of their data; some have
no data at all.
</p><p>T-Mobile texted the affected customers with a <a href="http://forums.t-mobile.com/tmbl/?category.id=Sidekick">link to this message</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
Personal information stored on your device - such as contacts, calendar entries, to-do lists or photos - that is 
no longer on your Sidekick almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger.
</blockquote>
<p>Long story short: No backups.
</p>
<h3 id="w_the-story-is-a-sad-one-told-many-times">The story is a sad one, told many times</h3>
<p>Microsoft chose to make no backups, reports Sidekick news website 
<a href="http://www.hiptop3.com/archives/what-caused-the-sidekick-fail">Hiptop3.com</a>. It seems the team at Microsoft in 
charge of user data storage allowed an upgrade to the storage system with no backup in place. When the upgrade 
failed, the data was toast.
</p><p>This sad story of "no backups" is something that sysadmins -- myself included --
find ourselves in from time to time. Toward the end of 2006, the "Leafycaust"
(disk failure with no backups at leafyhost.com) destroyed lots of data for 
<a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>. I had my own catastrophe in
mid-2007 when two disks connected in RAID-1 (which is not a backup system)
failed within two days of each other. (I now run nightly off-site backups for
all the systems I maintain.)
</p><p>People who rely on computers ought to make sure the people responsible are doing those
backups, and that the backups are actually <i>usable</i>. Students for Free Culture
was a Leafyhost customer; T-Mobile is a Microsoft customer. It's somewhat humorous that
Microsoft and Leafyhost provide the same level of assurance.
</p>
<h3 id="w_im-about-to-cry">"im about to cry!"</h3>
<p>In the Hiptop3.com article above, users tell their own sad stories and give advice.
</p>
<ul><li> "Since then, I’ve cried twice."
</li><li> "Fortunately, through Facebook, I’ve been able to contact one of my brothers who gave me my parents’ numbers."
</li><li> "im about to cry!"
</li><li> "For those of you out there who think your information is safe. Learn from this please. Store information online, on paper, on a phone, everywhere. Invest the time!"
</li></ul>
<p><b>Invest the time.</b> It's good advice.
</p><p>Everyone: Please make backups. Don't trust any one thing - your IT staff, your personal computer, or your paid service provider, to keep your
data safe. (For more technical readers: Don't rely purely on your DBMS, your filesystem, or one particular location. You know the drill; now practice it.)
</p><p>I'll conclude with a quote. This one is about the Leafycaust, but it could easily be about Microsoft/Danger:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://theologicalstatic.blogspot.com/2006/12/how-not-to-run-business.html">Essentially, these notjobs burn through several thousand dollars of people’s money for the service of deleting all their critical (and personal) data.</a>
