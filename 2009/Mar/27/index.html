		<p>For my attendees, and anyone else following along at home:
</p><p>Thanks for coming! I had a great time at the talk, and I already
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon09-scraping-fun.html">wrote a little bit about how much fun I had</a>.
I wanted to be sure to conclude the tutorial with some next steps for you all.
</p>
<h2 id="w_the-presentation">The presentation</h2>
<p>Some crucial links:
</p>
<ul><li> My presentation: <a href="http://svn.asheesh.org/svn/public/20082009/pycon/slides3.pdf">the actual PDF I used</a>
</li><li> Sample code: <a href="http://svn.asheesh.org/svn/public/20082009/pycon/examples/">in the examples directory</a> (note you can "svn checkout" that too)
</li></ul>
<h2 id="w_the-demos-that-didnt-work">The demos that didn't work</h2>
<p>There were two demos that were less smooth than they ought to have been.
</p>
<ul><li> Selenium RC, and
</li><li> WordPress Hash Cash.
</li></ul>
<p>For WordPress Hash Cash, there's the <i>lovely</i> simple code I wrote that uses python-spidermonkey
to post comments to a blog with HashCash. One such blog is online at <a href="http://pycon09.asheesh.org/hashcash/">http://pycon09.asheesh.org/hashcash/</a>&nbsp;;
<i>please</i> try it! (The reason it didn't work was some heavy load on my server during the talk.)
</p><p>For Selenium RC, you can see the sample code in examples/seleniumrc/. There is a README
in that directory that explains clearly how to run that code. (It didn't work for the same reason.)
</p>
<h2 id="w_the-future">The future</h2>
<p>I'm available for questions, both hands-on at PyCon and by email after the weekend. Just email me!

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon09-scraping-fun.html">"Scrape the web" at PyCon: lots of fun!
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Thursday morning at 9 am, I gave my scheduled tutorial at PyCon:
<a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/tutorials/schedule/2AM8/">Scrape the Web: Strategies for programming websites that don't expect it</a>.
</p><p>For those of you who attended, <i>thank you!</i> You made it loads of fun. The tutorial was supposedly full
at 30 people, but in fact we had at least five more; at the halfway break, staff added another table to the room
so that those of you standing in the back could sit down!
</p><p>Because I was so behind on so many things from travel, I stayed up all night before the talk. This is actually 
fun for me, as we saw <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/packaging.html">at Debconf last year</a>. So I arrived 
at the talk energized and with my examples fleshed-out (for the most part).
</p><p>There were a few ways I knew things were going well.
</p><p>Early on in the talk, <a href="http://yergler.net/">Nathan Yergler</a> arrived and saw that we were scraping information 
from the CC <a href="http://mehfilindian.com/LunchMenuTakeOut.htm">lunch mainstay Mehfil Indian</a>, nicknamed "Curry in a 
hurry." This caused a ricochet of smiles between me at the front and Nathan at the back; I hope that 
helped the mood for others, too!
</p><p>Throughout the talk, the audience looked happy, and they felt comfortable enough to stop me and ask questions. 
Knowing that the audience feels comfortable participating is crucial for me. Participation and questioning are 
part of learning; they are also the best way for me to know how to tailor what topics I cover to the people in 
the room.
</p><p>After the talk, some attendees handed in evaluation forms. One man asked me what he should do with his.
"I've been putting them in this box face-down," I explained.
</p><p>He suggested, "This one you ought to see face-up!"
</p><p>About five people came up after the talk and asked me specific questions. 
One was a young lady who attended my
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/baypiggies-jan-8.html">preview talk at Baypiggies</a> in January,
which was great to see.
</p><p>The same number came up to me at the end and thanked me for a good talk, which was very rewarding.
One asked how often I give talks at conferences. I mentioned 
<a href="http://mehfilindian.com/LunchMenuTakeOut.htm">my OSCON talk with Nathan</a>, and wondered to myself
what other conference sessions I had led. He urged me, "You really ought to make speaking part of your
career. You're a great speaker."
</p><p>I followed a couple of attendees to lunch; one pointed out the room had been Twittering madly during the talk. A
<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=pycon+scrape+OR+scraping+OR+asheesh">search of Twitter</a> shows
a lot of positive comments. (He also pointed out that someone else is "paulproteus" on Twitter.)
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/pydanny">pydanny</a>: is happy with what he got out of Asheesh Laroia's Scrape the Web tutorial
</li><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/AceGopher">AceGopher</a>: So much goodness in Scrape the Web!
</li><li> <a href="http://identi.ca/phrakture">http://identi.ca/phrakture</a> (on identi.ca): Referer is misspelled in the HTTP spec - hah
</li><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/sgbirch">sgbirch</a>: Screen saving talk off to a great start. Asheesh Laroia is a good speaker, this is informative and fun.
</li><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/brianfive">brianfive</a>: enjoyed the "Scraping the Web" tutorial at #pycon. Why use an API, when you can just grab it off the page?&nbsp;:)
</li></ul>
<p>Basically, everybody loves me. Yay!
</p><p>By the end of lunch, I was fading from the lack of sleep. I took a six-hour nap, and I woke up after
all the official PyCon proceedings were over. I read an email from Greg Lindstrom,
organizer of the Tutorials series of talks at PyCon. His email began:
</p>
<blockquote>
It's Thursday night and I wanted to tell you how happy I am with the
tutorials over the past two days.  I haven't looked at the survey results
yet -- give me a couple weeks on that; I'll share the results with you --
but the comments I heard were overwhelmingly positive.  My favorite was
overhearing someone ask <i>"how did that kid in 'scrape the web' learn all of that?"</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>I giggled about this as I walked to dinner with Nathan.
</p><p>What a great start to PyCon!
