</p><p>Thanks for coming! I had a great time at the talk, and I already
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon09-scraping-fun.html">wrote a little bit about how much fun I had</a>.
I wanted to be sure to conclude the tutorial with some next steps for you all.

<p>There were two demos that were less smooth than they ought to have been.
</p>
<ul><li> Selenium RC, and

</li></ul>
<p>For WordPress Hash Cash, there's the <i>lovely</i> simple code I wrote that uses python-spidermonkey
to post comments to a blog with HashCash. One such blog is online at <a href="http://pycon09.asheesh.org/hashcash/">http://pycon09.asheesh.org/hashcash/</a>&nbsp;;
<i>please</i> try it! (The reason it didn't work was some heavy load on my server during the talk.)
</p><p>For Selenium RC, you can see the sample code in examples/seleniumrc/. There is a README
in that directory that explains clearly how to run that code. (It didn't work for the same reason.)

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon09-scraping-fun.html">"Scrape the web" at PyCon: lots of fun!
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Thursday morning at 9 am, I gave my scheduled tutorial at PyCon:
<a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/tutorials/schedule/2AM8/">Scrape the Web: Strategies for programming websites that don't expect it</a>.
</p><p>For those of you who attended, <i>thank you!</i> You made it loads of fun. The tutorial was supposedly full
at 30 people, but in fact we had at least five more; at the halfway break, staff added another table to the room
so that those of you standing in the back could sit down!
</p><p>Because I was so behind on so many things from travel, I stayed up all night before the talk. This is actually 
fun for me, as we saw <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/packaging.html">at Debconf last year</a>. So I arrived 
at the talk energized and with my examples fleshed-out (for the most part).
</p><p>There were a few ways I knew things were going well.
</p><p>Early on in the talk, <a href="http://yergler.net/">Nathan Yergler</a> arrived and saw that we were scraping information 
from the CC <a href="http://mehfilindian.com/LunchMenuTakeOut.htm">lunch mainstay Mehfil Indian</a>, nicknamed "Curry in a 
hurry." This caused a ricochet of smiles between me at the front and Nathan at the back; I hope that 
helped the mood for others, too!
</p><p>Throughout the talk, the audience looked happy, and they felt comfortable enough to stop me and ask questions. 
Knowing that the audience feels comfortable participating is crucial for me. Participation and questioning are 
part of learning; they are also the best way for me to know how to tailor what topics I cover to the people in 
the room.
</p><p>After the talk, some attendees handed in evaluation forms. One man asked me what he should do with his.
"I've been putting them in this box face-down," I explained.
</p><p>He suggested, "This one you ought to see face-up!"
</p><p>About five people came up after the talk and asked me specific questions. 
One was a young lady who attended my
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/baypiggies-jan-8.html">preview talk at Baypiggies</a> in January,
which was great to see.
</p><p>The same number came up to me at the end and thanked me for a good talk, which was very rewarding.
One asked how often I give talks at conferences. I mentioned 
<a href="http://mehfilindian.com/LunchMenuTakeOut.htm">my OSCON talk with Nathan</a>, and wondered to myself
what other conference sessions I had led. He urged me, "You really ought to make speaking part of your
career. You're a great speaker."
</p><p>I followed a couple of attendees to lunch; one pointed out the room had been Twittering madly during the talk. A
<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=pycon+scrape+OR+scraping+OR+asheesh">search of Twitter</a> shows
a lot of positive comments. (He also pointed out that someone else is "paulproteus" on Twitter.)
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/pydanny">pydanny</a>: is happy with what he got out of Asheesh Laroia's Scrape the Web tutorial
</li><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/AceGopher">AceGopher</a>: So much goodness in Scrape the Web!
</li><li> <a href="http://identi.ca/phrakture">http://identi.ca/phrakture</a> (on identi.ca): Referer is misspelled in the HTTP spec - hah
</li><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/sgbirch">sgbirch</a>: Screen saving talk off to a great start. Asheesh Laroia is a good speaker, this is informative and fun.
</li><li> <a href="http://twitter.com/brianfive">brianfive</a>: enjoyed the "Scraping the Web" tutorial at #pycon. Why use an API, when you can just grab it off the page?&nbsp;:)
</li></ul>
<p>Basically, everybody loves me. Yay!
</p><p>By the end of lunch, I was fading from the lack of sleep. I took a six-hour nap, and I woke up after
all the official PyCon proceedings were over. I read an email from Greg Lindstrom,
organizer of the Tutorials series of talks at PyCon. His email began:
</p>
<blockquote>
It's Thursday night and I wanted to tell you how happy I am with the
tutorials over the past two days.  I haven't looked at the survey results
yet -- give me a couple weeks on that; I'll share the results with you --
but the comments I heard were overwhelmingly positive.  My favorite was
overhearing someone ask <i>"how did that kid in 'scrape the web' learn all of that?"</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>I giggled about this as I walked to dinner with Nathan.
</p><p>What a great start to PyCon!

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/free-culture/fsf-award.html">FSF Award for Projects of Social Benefit
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Last weekend, I attended the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>'s
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/">LibrePlanet 2009</a> conference.
</p><p>The first day was a full day of talks from Free Software luminaries
including Jeremy Allison of Samba and Evan Podromou of identi.ca. During
the talks, the conference IRC chat room was brimming with conversation;
between talks, so were the hallways.
</p><p>The day concluded in an award ceremony. We joked around on IRC:
<pre>&lt;paulproteus&gt; Man, I probably didn't get EITHER award.
&lt;gmaxwell&gt; paulproteus, cause I got both! ha!
</pre>
<p>Richard Stallman happily presented the Award for the Advancement of 
Free Software to Wietse Venema for writing the Postfix mail server.
Then he continued to announce the Award for Projects of Social Benefit,
awarded...
</p><p>"...to Creative Commons."
</p><p>Mike Linksvayer kept sitting at his laptop.
</p><p>"Shouldn't we go get that?" I asked him.
</p><p>"Yeah," he answered, not moving from his computer.
</p><p>"Should I come with you?" I asked.
</p><p>"Yes," he said crisply.
</p><p>And up we went.
</p><p><a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2008_free_software_awards">Richard handed Mike the award</a>,
and I stood next to Mike as Richard explained to the audience that he wished
Creative Commons would talk more about freedom. As Mike accepted the
award from the lectern, I did my best to not grin like an absolute idiot.
I managed to look somewhat serious in the photo
<a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2009/03/25/happy-hacking/">as Mike cropped it</a>;
maybe that's the effect of the shadows.
</p><p><img alt="Laroia, Linksvayer, RMS" src="http://asheesh.org/pub/image/fsf-award/fsf-award-09-cc-detail.jpg" width="480" height="240" />
</p><p><small>Asheesh Laroia and Mike Linksvayer of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13568">Creative Commons</a> accept the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2008_free_software_awards">2008 Free Software Foundation Award for Project of Social Benefit</a> from Richard Stallman. Detail of photo by Matt Hins / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-SA</a>. (Cropped image and this caption by Mike.)</small>
</p><p>I was immensely pleased. Creative Commons and Free Software, as organizations and as movements,
are about lifting unneeded or immoral burdens copyright law levies on people who want to
remix, improve, and share. These movements tie together as Free Culture, and they have been a huge part of my life.
Moreover, Free Software was the first empowerment movement I could concretely understand.
</p><p>"Happy hacking!" said Stallman to us as we walked off stage.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/event/etech-2009-baobab.html">Today at ETech: Baobab Health Partnership
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>(I mostly live-blogged this; excuse the messiness.)
</p><p>Mike McKay gave a
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/et2009/public/schedule/detail/5348">fantastic presentation</a>
about his work at Baobab Health Partnership. To quote his blurb:
</p>
<blockquote>
Malawi, Africa, has a population of 14 million. One million are HIV 
positive and there are just 280 doctors in the country.
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.baobabhealth.org/">Baobab Health Partnership</a> took i-openers,
added a PIC to create a touch-screen, and
hacked on Power over Ethernet,
and configured them to be used as data
entry and analysis workstations for HIV clinics in Malawi.
</p><p>The i-opener was an "Internet appliance" sold as a simple web terminal: given a monthly subscription
for the i-opener service, you could have an inexpensive, trouble-free web browsing experience.
As it happened, the community swiftly repurposed the devices. According to one i-opener hacker,
"<a href="http://www.ghettohardware.com/articles/iopener/">What follows</a> is discussion and photographs of a most righteous hack, turning the nearly-free Netpliance i-opener web appliance into a full featured pseudolaptop / electronic photo album."
Slashdot saw a lot of excitement around these in 2000 and 2001, but they lacked Ethernet or wifi, so they
fell out of favor.
</p><p>I wanted to give you that background so I can explain that
the Baobab Health terminal is the <i>coolest</i> thing I have <i>ever</i> heard of anyone doing with an i-opener. 
This puts my kitchen recipe terminal plan to shame. Check out <a href="http://www.baobabhealth.org/2007/06/26/patient-registration-video/">patient registration video</a>
that shows the terminals in use.
</p><p>The software stack is all open source: They have an Ubuntu server running MySQL and Ruby on Rails, and the 
user interface is just an AJAX web application running in 
full-screen mode. It was developed by Malawaian developers who, says McKay, 
"were trained in VB. Now they hang out on IRC and flame people on 
mailing lists. They're part of the Internet."
</p><p>As they bought a few from eBay for about thirty dollars, they noticed
that one person in Nebraska seemed to keep listing them. It turned out that
he had been stockpiling the until he figured out something great to do with them.
In the end, the Nebraskan gave them two <b>thousand</b> i-openers. (The twentieth century rises again.)
</p><p>As far as impact, McKay pointed out decision support makes
a huge difference in healthcare, as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/01/14/ST2009011402914.html">Provonost found at Hopkins years ago</a>
with checklists. He also talked about how they data validation
dramatically changed the clinics' ability to record useful data; most of the previous
paper records were found to be useless as they began to import them into the computerized system. Through comparisons to other people of similar
age and gender, they can encourage correct weight measurement data entry. <a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/">Danny O'Brien</a>
pointed out that this does not degrade well in the case of equipment or network failure. I believe Danny was hinting at the
question of what happens when the entire system fails (backups? data loss?); McKay understood it to refer to
what happens during temporary failures. He explained that with their generators, they've had very good reliability.
When the computers fail, many clinics take paper records instead, though some simply lock the doors and stop seeing patients.
That clinics choose the latter approach has provided strong motivation for their programmers to fix reliability issues!
</p><p>McKay went on an aside to talk about having his appendix removed when he was in the States. "All of a sudden, I was exposed to the American 
health care system, and I was <i>shocked</i> at how broken it is. There's no computers anywhere! The only computers around are at billing."
</p><p>To get to electronic medical records in the US, he says, "Maybe we just need a disruptive piece of technology."
</p><p>As for how to spread the program to other countries or circumstances, McKay explained,
"One of our problems is the next generation of hardware.
I'm not going to send this hacked i-opener to a country where there aren't technicians who know what to do with them."
</p><p>The program was started by Gerry Douglas in 2000. Douglas is now based in Pittsburgh, though he spends four to five months of the year in 
Malawi. Also, the data collected by the project inform policy discussions at a quarterly HIV Forum in Malawi. A man from the NIH suggested that 
they work on sharing that data and doing more research.
</p><p>The presentation was fantastic; the work is brilliant; and the man is friendly and thoughtful.

		<p>I prefer to host my own Internet services. Here is a quick summary of what I have found in the past two hours of my life:

<ul><li> The (in)famous Gallery is working on a version 3 which looks quite nice. The only way to add photos is through a Flash tool that segfaults Firefox and Epiphany here.
</li><li> Coppermine Gallery looks like it's still stuck in 2001.
</li><li> phpWebGallery renamed itself to Piwigo, which looks nice. However, it does not automatically rotate photos when generating thumbnails.

<p>It's 2009. Am I just going to use Flickr and call it a day?
</p><p>I selected these by looking through web photo gallery programs <a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=photo+gallery&section=projects&Go.x=0&Go.y=0">on freshmeat.net</a>.
I'd like a dynamic one so I can accept comments.
</p><p>It does seem there are some decent galleries for WordPress, in particular <a href="http://nextgen.boelinger.com/">NextGEN Gallery</a>.
</p><p>What do others in the <a href="http://autonomo.us">autonomous world</a> do? Am I supposed to write my own?
</p><p>(Waiting for Gallery3 is probably a good path forward, failing that.)

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/people/on-on-watchmen.html">That LJ post about Watchmen - Yeah, it sucked
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>My friend Lisa pointed me to Andrei's review of Watchmen.
</p><p>The review begins with surprises. In the edited version that is online now, we learn watching
the movie caused "the destruction of all of [Andrei's] 
hopes and dreams." That's a sizable investment for a movie based on a comic book.
Furthermore, he writes on his LiveJournal post that he felt "punished with awkward sex and slow-mo violence."
One would think that a LJer would be pleased with both of those!
</p><p>Andrei asks, "Is producing copious amounts of blood the only way to generate a dark mood?" This must be a 
rhetorical question; any LJer worth his salt knows that changing the theme and typing in all lowercase can do 
that, too. (In fairness, Lisa points out that this is difficult to achieve in a movie.)
</p><p>Lisa mentions that a previous version of the post called people who like the movie "sheep."
It's good that Andrei does not call them goats, else he raise the ire of
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/site/goat.bml">Frank the Goat</a>, LiveJournal's beloved mascot.
Presumably Frank's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal#Frank_the_Goat">global fanbase</a> would have risen up in anger, too.
(Frank the Goat has <a href="http://frank.livejournal.com/10510.html">previously written about his ambivalence about not being a sheep</a>.)
</p><p>There are many things in this review I would not have said. Despite the temptation,
I would especially not have shared this utterance with <a href="http://quinnnorton.com/">my new friend Quinn</a>, the first 
person I know to have seen the movie: "Comedian bad, but torn and damaged individual."
</p><p>The story of Andrei's post is a case study in dramatic irony. He writes of the voice acting, "We got the same 
crap Bale did in Batman where he thinks making your voice gravelly gives it more gravitas. No, it doesn't." 
It seems that Andrei thinks calling your friends sheep gives your voice more gravitas.
As his friends teach him in the comment section: No, it doesn't.
</p><p>At least Andrei's <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/andrei/12944809.jpg">user picture</a>
(unmodified from <a href="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/61780630/12944809">original</a>) does elicit
the appropriate sense of gravitas.

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that Google has finally done it: they shipped Multics for 386 (and 
compatible).
</p><p><i><a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">NoiseBridge</a></i>, this evening: I descended the stairs after teaching my 
introduction to programming class and found <a href="http://www.geoffschmidt.com/">Geoff Schmidt</a> in our San 
Francisco hacker space.
</p><p>I sat next to Geoff and overheard a lovely conversation with Mike Kan. Geoff told the sad tale of a 
beautiful, efficient, and dead operating system: Multics. Multics was written in the 1960s as a fast 
operating system for many users to share an expensive mainframe. It posed design problems never 
seriously tackled before, and after a decade, it had a practically perfect implementation for each of 
them. To achieve speed, it expected help from the hardware: registers on the processor split memory into 
different "segments," creating safe zones for each program to run in. The segment system was powerful and 
secure enough that a running process could execute code from another without the operating system kernel 
getting involved. The result was a fantasy come true: protection rings creating legendary security, the 
flexibility of a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system, and all this at hardly any performance 
overhead.
</p><p>(Naturally, such perfection is the result of years of work at MIT. So is Geoff.)
</p><p>This perfection came at a price: while Multics was uniquely well-designed and well-integrated, it 
expected specific support from the hardware it ran on.
</p><p>Geoff's expression deflated, and he pointed out that another operating system arrived on the scene: UNIX. 
Anyone could study the UNIX source code, and it ran on whatever you gave it.
UNIX (a joke on the name Multics) eventually won by being 
<a href="http://naggum.no/worse-is-better.html">worse</a>: it was slow, unreliable, and worst of all: <i><a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">incorrect</a></i>.
But anyone could read it and make it work on the computer he happened to have.
By the mid-1970s, UNIX's dominance over Multics was clear.
</p><p>Geoff skipped forward a decade to the 1980s. Intel had wanted to build a CPU that could be used as a 
modern computer, and users had shown that the puny memory protection system offered by the 286 wasn't 
adequate. The chip designers went back to the drawing board, and they brought back features that Multics 
invented: segmentation registers and protection rings. When shown these powerful, complex features, 
today's operating systems mostly ignore these Multics tricks and do the least work possible to build a 
UNIX-like flat memory model.
</p><p>Mike interrupted and howled about how he can't buy a "real Macintosh" anymore; Apple's computers were 
once based on a simple architecture, but now they are built with the same complex Intel CPUs everyone 
else uses.
</p><p>But I am writing this because of the release of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">Google Native Client</a>,
a browser extension that allows your computer to <i>securely</i> run machine code written by untrusted
people on the Internet. How can it achieve this fantasy? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">Wikipedia article</a>
summarizes <a href="http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nacl/googleclient/native_client/documentation/nacl_paper.pdf">the native client research paper</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Native Client is notable for its novel sandboxing technique which makes use of the x86 architecture's rarely-used segmentation facility.</blockquote>

		<p>When I see that MoveOn has put this in my email box:
<pre>Subject: 10 Things You've Gotta Know About Obama's Plan
</pre>
<p>I procrastinate reading it, and I prepare for the worst.
</p><p>Finally, later in the day, I manage the strength to open it. The list
is not the doom and compromise I expected but instead ten lovely things.
</p><p>The article cites <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/washington/27web-tax.html">the New York times</a> and declares,
"[Obama's budget] lets the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire."
</p><p>With grace, President Obama lets the worst of the Bush cuts expire; 
they're just a thousand memories.

       </h1>
		<p>I just did something that is way more exciting than it is technically novel:
make my own ringtone that plays when people call my phone.
</p><p>If you see me tapping desks or laptops or counter-tops rhythmically,
usually I'm thinking of the guiro that starts out the R.E.M. song, "Electrolite."
So I opened up the audio file I have for that song in Audacity, selected just the quiet part at the start,
trimmed the silence, boosted it up 25 dB, and transferred it to my phone.
(If you like, you can <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/pub/ringtone/guiro.wav">listen to that audio file</a>.)
</p><p>Once it was on my phone, the rather-neat <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ringdroid/">Ringdroid</a> app took over 
and helped me set it as a system ringtone.
</p><p><i>Yay!</i>
