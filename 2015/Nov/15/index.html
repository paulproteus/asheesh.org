        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/rmad/broken-radio.html">Broken Radio</a>
       </h1>
		<p>
This is the third track on 1999's <cite>Look Now, Look Again</cite>, the same album as we glimpsed yesterday.  This is another favorite from the album.  As always, <a href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/looknow.html#brokenradio">read the lyrics</a> or <a href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/03-Broken%20Radio.mp3">listen to the song</a>.
</p><p>
This song is light on words.  It begins instrumentally and repeats, "Traffic lights turning yellow."  (I used to hear "dim and yellow.")  We learn a little bit more, "A kiss and a slap on the roof."  As it repeats, the listener wonders, "What is this about, and why does she care?"
</p><p>
It turns out the the external action of the traffic light reminds her of the feelings of a personal action.  Such reminders are better when you're in a different context than when they happened.  This is perhaps the best type: She interrupts a repetition to tell us that she taught it to someone.
</p><p>
Internal repetition for analogy is typical Rainer Maria, and I'm a sucker for it.  Here it's about "the last time."  (The harmony, not just the phrase, repeats.)  That someone is, of course, an ex.  Kyle and Caithlin harmonize from "winks out" until the end of the verse.  Interestingly, she seems to always hold the note a fraction longer than he does.  Maybe that's because she's "lead vocals," or maybe it's because she's the one with the (ever so slightly) greater emotional burden at the end of this relationship.
</p><p>
Kyle drops out and quiets the guitar to let her gush:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
And I'm certain, if I drive into those trees, <br />
It'll make less of a mess <br />
then you've made of me. <br />
</blockquote>
</p><p>
To deliver words like this convincingly, she takes a breath to switch from her frustrated crescendo to a meek near-whisper for the last line.
</p><p>
The words are over before two minutes are up, and for voices we're left with Kyle and Caithlin harmonizing on "Ooh".  This is actually some of Kyle's smoother singing (look at the album called <cite>Rainer Maria</cite> for other styles of Kyle, including raw screams).  The "Oohs" are structured in groups of four.  The last in each group is backed by a final-feeling chord, but Kyle and Caithlin vary their harmonies for the others.  Maybe she's thinking of the ways things could have been different and how they'd still end the same.  The last of these final-feeling chords pushes through the last of these "Oohs," and we're left with a few seconds of silence to think before the next song starts.
</p><p>
What is the "broken radio" that they're talking over?  It could be some sort of literal bad communication system (e.g., a distorted cell phone), but to me it seems the two people are sitting right next to each other.  As she drives, they try to find words for how feelings changed; as she fails to find words, she understands how hurt she is.
</p><p>
What do you do when you share something like this with someone but then break up?  The outside world now gets to poke at the raw wound.  Do you focus on making the memory a happy one of how things were or instead on what things could have been?  Imagine if there's a decision you made before the break-up about a way to live your life that you now have to recontextualize; before, you could justify in terms of "both of you," but what if it doesn't stand up to justification in terms of just "self"?
</p><p>
This song isn't interested in answering questions like this, just reminding us of how difficult they can be.  And as one of the classically sad Rainer Maria songs about failed relationships, it lays no blame.

       </h1>
		<p>
Time is running out, so tonight's episode will be a double feature.  Rainer Maria's newest 
(2006) album is called <cite>Catastrophe Keeps Us Together</cite>.  These two songs are 
"Catastrophe" (<a 
href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/catastrophe.html#catastrophe">read the lyrics</a> 
and <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/01%20-%20Rainer%20Maria%20-%20Catastrophe.mp3">download 
the song</a>) and "Burn" (<a 
href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/catastrophe.html#burn">read the lyrics</a> and <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/03%20-%20Rainer%20Maria%20-%20Burn.mp3">download 
the song</a>).
</p><p>
These were the two songs they released as previews in the year or so before they actually 
released the album.  "burn-96kbps.mp3" ("First Malcolm mixes") was on their website as a 
preview for a long time, and "Catastrophe" (the album version) was on their website as a 
preview too.  It's also the song they made the music video for the album out of.  So I think 
Rainer Maria considers them flagship songs on the album.  They're tracks 1 and 3 
respectively.
</p><p>
<h4>Catastrophe</h4>
</p><p>
"Catastrophe keeps us together," begins and repeats this song.  It's also the name of the 
album.  This is the first time that Rainer Maria named an album after a song on it.  
R.E.M.'s most recent album is the first time they did that, too.  I hate to be harsh, but I 
do think both are the weakest shows so far from both artists.
</p><p>
To me, the song is musically strong but lyrically weak.  It's vaguely political, asking:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Do you think we could go on forever <br />
when the architects of the war <br />
are handing out the swords? <br />
</blockquote>
</p><p>
But I don't really know what that means.  It's as if that is mentioned to explain why "we", 
"the architects of the world," are "taking it all apart."  I can't get a solid grasp on who 
"we" are.  Catastrophe could keep us together if we're going to meet up in the afterlife 
(c.f., "I'm Gonna DJ at the End of the World" by R.E.M.), or if we're meeting up in this 
life to fight against those who created the catastrohpe.  But there's a sense of leaving the 
world in "taking it all apart."  Not to mention the varied imagery of how we are to find 
each other "at the end" (x3) of the world.
</p><p>
I've said before I've loved internal rhyme or repeated rhythms in Rainer Maria's sung 
lyrics.  Sadly, this song doesn't get to pluck that string in my heart; the repetition of 
phrases like "I've got a plan" are easier than intelligent rhythmic tricks of older songs.
</p><p>
Since Chris poointed out that I was focusing on the lyrics, I've been trying to make some 
notes about the music too.  All I'll say is that I really do like the music in 
"Catastrophe," and the sharpness of the repetitions of "at the end" and "how will you look" 
contribute to its validity as a head-bopper.
</p><p>
<h4>Burn</h4>
</p><p>
The "original" (read: early cut) "burn-96kbps.mp3" that I heard for a year before hearing 
the album version is quite a bit shorter.  Recently I commended Rainer Maria on being able 
to stop songs before they drag on, and I'm sorry to see that they didn't use that ability 
here.  "Burn" is four and a quarter minutes, but nearly the last full minute is repetition.  
They sing it that long in concert, too.  Curiously, the "First Malcolm mixes" version I have 
is only 3:25, nearly eliminating that last whole minute.  Curiouserly, the next song on the 
album is "Bottle", which makes its mark in 2 minutes, 26 seconds, and is no weaker for its 
short length.
</p><p>
Love starts out as as tyrannical fire led by Caithlin in this song, but in a later verse it 
is slightly softened to a sorcery.  "Believing in her" is tantamount to loving her, but she 
-- did what, exactly?  "Didn't know any better" supports the view that she could have 
requited the love but didn't see it in time.  But "I let you down" implies that she could 
have acted differently.
</p><p>
I should look into this further, but I get the feeling that the use of simile ("is like a 
tyranny") and less-than-certain metaphor ("some kind of sorcery") is a much weaker literary 
style for this band than direct comparison and metaphor.
</p><p>
I really wish that the song's lyrics elaborated on the burning or the ways she let this poor 
person down.  I hope that sometime during this blog, I can make a graph showing this song 
(and perhaps the album?) as a statistical outlier in how repetitive it is.  I admit to 
loving some Rainer Maria songs with obscure but tragic lyrics, but here there's not enough 
hints dropped for me to feel as much empathy as before.
</p><p>
As with many Rainer Maria songs, I've built my own meaning.  In a comparison to "Hell and 
High Water," I consider the chance that my variously daily failures are "let[ting] me down," 
and with too many of them I'll feel helpless and watch myself burn.
</p><p>
<h4>More to come</h4>
</p><p>
Yesterday I wrote, "Maybe I'm just a kid who wants easy-to-listen-to pop" out of Rainer 
Maria.  Now you hopefully see that's not actually true. (-: You'll hopefully get the sense 
that while I'm not in love with this album, I'm still happy to have it.  Look for more 
discussion of this album before this blog is over.

       </h1>
		<p>
This song is right at the middle of 2003's <cite>Long Knives Drawn</cite>.  With it, this blog moves forward into 
the twenty-first century.  We'll see how long that lasts.  You can <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/05-The%20Aweful%20Truth%20Of%20Loving.mp3">listen to the song</a>.  
If you can't follow that link, just go to <a href="http://emusic.com/">eMusic.com</a> and sign up for their free 
trial.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/longknives.html#theawfultruthofloving">official lyrics</a> are 
missing the words in <strong>bold</strong> and have instead the words in <strike>strikeout</strike>:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
I want it to be sweet, so <strong>you won't</strong> <strike>(don't)</strike> disappoint me.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The official lyrics give a message of strength, but that's not the real feeling of the song.  Take these questions:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Should I be with you? <br />
Should I forget about me? 
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The first could be good, but the second one is a terrible idea.  It's self-effacing.  If "all the new thinking" (a 
reference to self-help?) "is about individuality," then to counter that you can forget about yourself.  But I think 
that's the wrong approach; for thinking about loving, the opposite of "individuality" is thinking of a couple as 
<em>two people together</em>.  I'm sure a couple of people reading this blog can attest to how doomed a manner of 
thinking that is.
</p><p>
At the end, in the third repeat of the reprise, I swear I hear this slipped in:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
And all <strong>that you're</strong> thinking <br />
is about individuality.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
I like the metaphor of peaches bruised by falling.  (So might Christian fundamentalists, I suppose.)  It's 
appropriate for her feelings of powerlessness: she can see the beautiful imagined relationship, but it's never that 
perfect by the time she gets into it.  I also like the internal rhyme, "And by the time / you bide your time."
</p><p>
One of the things that makes the song so great for me is these lines toward the end:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
and when the stakes are high <br />
I'm careless with the dice 
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The singer seems desperate, "pushing [her] luck all the time," but when I sing these lines to myself, I feel 
empowered.  Choosing to be careless with the dice makes me feel like the things that worry me aren't so important, 
and being able to feel lighter about things helps me worry less and do more.  It's also a great line to harmonize 
against. (-:

<p>I'm going to the last Rainer Maria concert.  If you didn't know they're breaking up, you <a 
href="http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/statusainthood/archives/2006/11/it_feels_a_litt.php">should read about that</a>.  Obviously, you can
<a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=nyc&query=detail&event=701947">buy tickets for the show I'm going to</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't know who they are, that's what this blog is for.  Sure, I could tell you about the origin of their name (a poet, Rainer Maria Rilke), or how 
they met (they got together in Madison, Wisconsin, at college of course), or how much their music means to me (a lot).  But there's no time for that; their 
last show as a band is December 17, 2006.</p>

<p>Instead, this blog is about <strong>Rainer Maria A Day</strong> ("RMAD").  Every day before their last show, I'll pick one of their songs and write about it.  
I'd love to get feedback from fans and others as this goes on.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/rmad/ears-ring.html">Ears Ring</a>
       </h1>
		<p>
Ears Ring is the first song on <cite>Ears Ring EP</cite> or the third track on <cite>Long Knives Drawn</cite>, take your pick.  You can, as always, <a href="http://rmad@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/03-Ear Ring.mp3">listen to the song</a> and <a href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/longknives.html#earsring">read the lyrics</a>.
</p><p>
Give it a good listen.
</p><p>
Compare it to "Catastrophe."  "Catastrophe" plods along; while being the suggested song (indeed, the single) from the album, it starts slow and explains somehow sweetly but intensely, "I've got a plan."  I could never feel attached to the song; it feels like there's no real conflict.  Instead, "Ears Ring" is about an urgency of a sense of confusion.
</p><p>
Compare it to "Burn."  "Ears Ring" knows how to grow, and it knows how to end.  The song is short on lyrics, but the way Caithlin stretches the words between breaths and Kyle's fervor let her reveal a scene slowly, letting us imagine feelings we probably already know with enough time to really feel them.  The urgency allows it to repeat itself without feeling canned, and the sharp reminders of "love her" at the end jab you only a handful of times before ceasing.
</p><p>
On its own, the song is not just energetic, it's <em>forceful</em>.  "Have faith," we're urged at the start.  (Who can resist listening for those words when you need something uplifting?)  Who is the blue lady?  But you hear Caithlin <em>breathe</em> - or with this much music behind her, maybe she's gasping for air.  Her performance and Kyle's determined strumming (not to forget William's rhythm) 
</p><p>
After a few verses of the urgency, the song drops to half time to plead, "You already love her."  (Who can resist listening for these words when you need a push toward a girl?)  But how does that intertwine with the stinging arms, the ringing ears of failure?
</p><p>
If there's a vision of a poppy Rainer Maria, even one where reptition is as much a part of life as it is on "Catastrophe" or "Burn," this is the exemplar of how that vision can succeed.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/rmad/rain-yr-hand.html">Rain Yr Hand</a>
       </h1>
		<p>
This song appears on Rainer Maria's eponymous E.P. ("Rainer Maria") from 1997.  You can <a href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/selftitled.html#rainyrhand">read the lyrics</a> or <a href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/03-Rain%20Yr%20Hand.mp3">download the song</a>.  As always, I urge you to do both.
</p><p>
For what it's worth, R.E.M. made fun of this term "eponymous" by <strong>naming</strong> a collection of theirs literally, <cite>Eponymous</cite>.
</p><p>
I'm going to take a step away from formula for today's entry because my life has been so busy with schoolwork at the end of the semester and I'm doing this blog as much for me as for any of you readers (-:.  It will be interesting when work has real time boundaries (9 to 5, or more like 10 to 6) rather than school's ability to leak into my whole day and pervade my waking and sleeping moments.  These blog entries are just getting longer, but that's fine with me. (-:
</p><p>
This song isn't one of my favorites, but for this <cite>Rainer Maria A Day</cite> it's crucial to revisit some of Rainer Maria's earlier catalog.  Rainer Maria is widely-cited as beginning when the two singers met at a poetry workshop while in college, and this E.P. from 9 years ago is the earliest work I have of theirs.  Maybe I'm just a kid who wants easy-to-listen-to pop rather than the screaming and distortion and dissonance of their early work.  Songs like this are difficult to explain to parents or friends, so maybe I just avoided them so I could more easily defend my love for Rainer Maria.  Rainer Maria was something of a secret love of mine, and that definitely contributed to my tenderness for their music.
</p><p>
Even with all the distortion, songs on this E.P. like "Made in Secret" and our main topic, "Rain Yr Hand," show the versatility of the band.  Listen to how the end of "Made in Secret" has a totally different feel, a softness appropriate for the closing line, "This is a secret I haven't told to anyone."  "Portland" finishes quietly, too; this young and proud, Rainer Maria doesn't feel forced to fill the space with music.  "Rain Yr Hand", too, opens gentle.
</p><p>
The lyrics to this song (as with most of the album) are hard to understand, much harder than in their 1999-and-after work.  (Recall that the 1999 album <cite>A Better Version of Me</cite> was my introduction to Rainer Maria.)  Here, they're either screaming, whispering, or mumbling, it seems.  I would say Rainer Maria is very unlikely to play anything from this album at a show.  Listen to how this song uses sharp twists on the guitar (unless that really <em>is</em> Caithlin screaming...?) at the end of instrumental interludes to let the style change between verses.  When your most recent work has packed-with-sound songs like "Catastrophe" and songs with poppy crescendos and tempo shifts like "Burn," I don't think the new audience would be expecting any of this.  And maybe the band members themselves feel they've moved on to more exciting pastures, too.  When you consider richness of sound from Caithlin and the music from Kyle's guitar in more recent work, it's as if they learned to sing and play respectively, after all.  But I appreciate that in this album, half the songs are under three minutes, and they stop not abruptly but because simply because the songs succeeded at imparting a feeling.
</p><p>
This summer, while an intern at Creative Commons, I missed out on more than a few events because I wasn't 21 (yet; I now am).  "All-ages shows" indeed.
</p><p>
The words aren't vague; they set a scene where we understand the feeling being communicated.  The quiet introduction is appropriate for talking about deep, easily-mockable processes like identity formation.  To quote a <cite>Witness Theatre</cite> play I saw recently (that I recently quoted when I felt I wasn't being taken seriously enough), "I'm being vulnerable!".  You might would wonder about the tree fallen across the highway, but Rainer Maria songs are more about sharing a feeling as they are about inspiring thought.  They've never been about inspiring action.  Maybe Bad Religion's capacity at the latter is what made the two of them such a powerful combination when I first discovered them.
</p><p>
As I alluded to yesterday, you get to hear Kyle in his most singing-y mode around 2:30, and you can hear both him and Caithlin near-screaming at different parts.  So much of what I read of the band watches Kyle's voice fade away as the band becomes more polished.  In 1997, they don't mind distorting the final chord.

       </h1>
		
<p>This is the first song on the first album of theirs I ever heard.</p>

<p>I discovered Rainer Maria through eMusic.com.  Back in 2000 or 2001, 
I was upset that it seemed the only ways to enjoy digital music either 
involved breaking copyright law (Napster and friends) or handing lots of 
money to an evil set of corporations (buying new CDs).  I heard of 
eMusic through They Might Be Giants; they put all their music on this 
"all you can eat" music subscription service.  "Fine," I said to myself, 
"but is there any <strong>other</strong> music worth staying on this?"</p>

<p>I found the albums <cite>A Better Version of Me</cite> by Rainer 
Maria and <cite>The Process of Belief</cite> by Bad Religion.  With 
those two albums, I thought to myself, I can find a home for myself in 
the music on this website.</p>

<p>So this is the first song on that 2001 Rainer Maria album. I read a 
review while listening, and it pointed out the band's intelligence: "No 
one defies artificial light," the song begins.</p>

<blockquote>
I'll cut all your wires <br />
I never cared <br />
Cut all your wires <br />
What can be there? It's dead.
</blockquote>

<p>I used to hear, "What can be there instead?"  While the review I read 
praised the band for using the word "anathema" in an opening song, the 
review failed to mention that they don't use it right!  It should be, 
"Why is this technology anathema to me?"  Of course, they compromise 
with history in performance and sing it that way. (-:</p>

<p>Gosh, writing substance is harder than I thought.  Anyway, I like 
this song because it's about resistance; not in a violent way, but in 
the self-reflective way of, "What if I stop doing things the way 
everyone else does?"  After all, if only she could get away from it for 
a while, she "could always breathe [it] back in."</p>

<p>You don't have to be the same as everyone else.  You're free to 
re-imagine the world, and if you can limit your interaction with the 
world to those parts you agree with, then try doing that.  You can 
always breathe back in.</p>

<p>You can listen to the song if you have it, and you can <a 
href="http://www.rainermaria.com/discography/betterversion.html#artificiallight">read 
the lyrics</a> on the Rainer Maria website.</p>

<p>P.S. The blog doesn't have comments yet.  I know, I know; I'm working 
on it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Here's a <a href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/01-Artificial%20Light.mp3">link to the song</a>.</strong></p>

Today is the day of the last Rainer Maria show.  You should <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/08-CT Catholic.mp3">listen to CT Catholic</a> and <a 
href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/longknives.html#ctcatholic">read 
the lyrics</a>.
</p><p>
I like the way the "not tonight" chorus takes a full repetition to 
expose the phrase, "take you for granted," splitting it across two 
verses.  Does CT mean Connecticut?  And why is this song called "CT 
Catholic" when it doesn't seem to mention either "CT" or "Catholic"?
</p><p>
<blockquote>
   I was thinking of an ending                <br />
   we were barely even friends                <br />
</blockquote>
</p><p>
For some of you reading this, you hardly knew Rainer Maria before two 
weeks ago.  As for me, phrase cited above makes me think of the pressure 
of meeting new friends, especially datable ones.
</p><p>
I hope that the members of Rainer Maria enjoyed their existence as a 
unitary entity as much as us fans did.  I hope they don't feel the way 
this song opens:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
   maybe now <br />
   maybe now <br />
   we can lay our <br />
   weariness down <br />
</blockquote>
</p><p>
I like the carefree attitude of "plans that didn't mean anything" and 
the positive outlook of not needing any words.
</p><p>
I could scream the following lines into a dark room, and hopefully I'll 
get a chance to later tonight.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
   not tonight <br />
   not ever<br />
   again<br />
   will I take you<br />
<br />
   not tonight <br />
   not ever<br />
   again<br />
   for granted<br />
</blockquote>
</p><p>
This is the <a

of the tour</a>.  Goodbye, Rainer Maria.

       </h1>
		
<p>
"Hell and High Water" is one of my favorite Rainer Maria songs.  It, too, is on <cite>A Better 
Version of Me</cite> (2001).  In fact, for a while, I thought it was called "A Better Version of 
Me".  You can <a href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/betterversion.html#hellandhighwater">read 
the lyrics</a> on the Rainer Maria website and, if I've given you the password, <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/09-Hell%20And%20High%20Water.mp3">listen to the 
song</a>.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
I know I should just drop everything and let her sing <br />
She's a better version of me
</blockquote>
</p><p>
I used to hear, "and let her <em>think</em> she's a better version of me."
</p><p>
The song is about a girl "who'll pick up where I leave off."  Is the girl in the song imagined or 
real?  Is the singer's love being stolen by a girl "devising a better mouth just to kiss you"?  
Instead, maybe the singer is just trapped in her feelings of inadequacy.  The girl in 
seems too perfect to be real; how could she sort through the singer's memories?  Could she really 
have "never forgotten a name or a punchline"?  She's at once "picking her fights like she knows how 
to win them" and would be "brave when I run off"; she's an unstoppable force in her life.  Wouldn't 
that be nice to be?
</p><p>
I don't understand the line about speeders killing you on their tiny street; maybe it's a metaphor 
for how easily people rushing through life can feel like they're running you over.  In that vein, 
you can imagine businessmen in suits who "know what they want" nearly running over a thoughtful 
pedestrian.
</p><p>
Another question: In the quoted two lines above, is "She's a better version of me" what the girl is 
singing?  Or, instead, is watching the other girl sing enough to make the singer resigned to her 
inadequacy?  I always liked the pun, "I'm lost but she's found"; it's the same kind of pun.
</p><p>
The message of the song is the question, Do I resign myself to desperation and dream of a better 
version of myself?
</p><p>
There's not really an answer, but after a long song of self-doubt, the singer tries to reassure 
herself:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
I tell myself, You're not a fool.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
I like this song because I can summarize hope to myself by singing, "You're not a fool." Sometimes I 
even believe it.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/scribble/code/linux-3.8-precise.html">Linux 3.8 (or newer) on Ubuntu Precise (12.04)</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>At this time, the latest Linux kernel that has been specially prepared for use with Ubuntu 12.04 is based on Linux 3.8. The rest of this answer is about how to get Linux 3.8 within Ubuntu 12.04.</p>

<p>(Before I get into that, first an aside: you've linked to the "mainline kernel" PPA, a collection of Linux kernel packages that have not been specially tested and prepared by the Ubuntu kernel team. You can read more about <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/162616/should-i-upgrade-to-the-mainline-kernels">mainline kernels here</a>. The mainline kernels are not suggested for installation, except if you are doing tests or you experience a major problem that it can be resolved with a specific mainline kernel.)</p>

<p>The recommended way to get the latest kernel on Ubuntu 12.04 is to stay within Ubuntu 12.04, rather than enabling separate package archives like the PPA you linked to. The latest Ubuntu 12.04 provides special package names to install the more up-to-date packages.</p>

<p>To install them, open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and issue the following commands.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-raring
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-lts-raring
</code></pre>

<p>When the installation completes, you can reboot your system to boot from 3.8 kernel. (The above commands won't uninstall anything (unless your APT is somehow misconfigured), and definitely won't auto-reboot, so you can run the commands and then do the reboot at some later time.)</p>

<p>The bootloader that Ubuntu uses (Grub) lists the newer kernel first, so it will boot from 3.8 automatically (except if you have installed a newer than 3.8) (and except if you know you've customized Grub somehow).</p>

<p>A note about why 3.8: Because of the Long Term Support status of Ubuntu 12.04, many different kernels will be backported (aka specially prepared) from newer versions of Ubuntu. (Additionally, a backported graphics stack (X and related packages) is available.) The 12.04.3 version (that has been released on 22 August 2013) contains the latest kernel and graphics (X) packages from Ubuntu 13.04 (raring). Ubuntu raring has 3.8, so therefore the "backported" version of Linux from raring to precise is also 3.8.</p>

<p>A note about the best way to get an even fresher version, like 3.11: Wait for Ubuntu Saucy (13.10) to come out, and then wait (not very long) for the Ubuntu Long Term Support process to backport that to Precise (12.04). Per the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule" rel="nofollow">release schedule</a>, Saucy should be out on October 17. Then you will be able to install linux-image-generic-lts-saucy!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lyriki.com/Bad_Religion:52_Seconds">Maybe God is just a chemical fiction.</a></p>

<blockquote>"When I started in this field, the primary client was involved with alcohol," says David Bailey, a community resource specialist with the West Virginia Prevention Resource Center.  "I wish it were still alcohol."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Peter Cohen, medical director of the Maryland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration. . . pointed out that while hydrocodone abuse has grown slightly in Maryland since 2002, it is still far less commonly abused than street drugs like heroin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"You've got three choices," [Dotson] said. "You either die, go to prison or get saved. Mostly, people around here are dying."</blockquote>
<p>Those quotes speak for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>The most commonly prescribed product combines hydrocodone and acetaminophen, which is marketed under brand names like Vicodin and Lortab.</blockquote>
<p>All that Vicodin-selling spam is suddenly so much sadder now.</p>

<blockquote>The DEA is considering moving drugs containing hydrocodone from being classified as so-called Schedule III drugs to being Schedule II drugs.</blockquote>

       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say you run Ubuntu but want the freshest package of something 
from Debian Unstable.  Or you run Debian Stable and you want some crazy 
multimedia package that only Ubuntu packages.</p>

<p>For many packages, it is pretty easy to "backport" them between 
distributions or between releases.  Let's say you run Ubuntu or Debian 
stable and you want the latest version of my alpine package.  Here's 
what you do:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Make sure you have an appropriate deb-src line</h3>

<p>Backporting is the process of taking <em>source 
packages</em> and compiling them on your Debian(-like) system.  The 
easiest way to find Debian "source packages" is the same way you find 
Debian "binary packages": apt-get and its configuration.</p>

<p>Make sure you have this line in /etc/apt/sources.list:</p>

<blockquote>deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main</blockquote>

<h3>Step 2: apt-get update</h3>

<h3>Step 3: install "apt-src"</h3>

<p>Just do 'sudo aptitude install apt-src'.  apt-src is a helper program 
that makes compiling source packages easy.  It's not necessary, but 
it prevents you from having to type too many commands.</p>

<h3>Step 4: apt-src -bi install $package</h3>

<p>If you wanted to install 'alpine', just do:</p>

<blockquote>apt-src -bi install alpine</blockquote>

<p>The "b" stands for "build", the "i" stands for "install the resulting 
package", and the word "install" means "download the source for alpine 
as found in a Debian source line from sources.list".  apt-src will 
"install" the source into the current directory, make sure you have all 
the required packages to build the package (a process called "satisfying 
the build dependencies"), build it, and install the resulting .debs.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Run the new program</h3>

<p>You should be done now!</p>

government's take:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/washington/23nsa.html?hp">

<p>I don't "worry" they could bankrupt the utilities.  I 
<strong>hope</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is no incentive for these corporations, and others in a long

law: companies will simply do illegal things and then explain that if 
the law were enforced, they'd have to pay some money.</p>

<p>I've been screaming and swearing about this for a week.  I can't

<p>That was for for 250,000 computers.  When the evidence is laid out 
against people at AT&T, if the evidence says they defrauded and 
wiretapped at least 100 times that many people, what will their 
punishment be?</p>

<p>I'm rooting for 60 * 100 years in jail, spread evenly among the 
people who did the wiretapping.  Or perhaps 60 * 100 years for each

<p>I'm starting a new project called "fetchvoicemail".  The idea is to 
have a little app that dials my voice mail, saves the messages, and 
extracts the metadata from the remote bot, and saves it all to local 
storage.  That way I can write whatever UI I want on top of it.  Think 
of it as POP3 for voicemail.</p>

<p>It seems there is already a commercial service that does this called 
"GotVoice Premium" that was <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,139412/article.html">reviewed by PC World</a>.</p>

<p>So far, I'm in experiment and read mode.  All I've yet discovered is

<p>I am making calls from and receiving calls to my Neo 1973.  This is 
wonderful.  I can do it thanks to the porting of QTopia to the FIC Neo 
1973 platform!  There was this <a 
href="http://trolltech.com/company/newsroom/announcements/press.2007-09-17.9260755578">press 
release</a> as well as live, nude downloadable source and binaries as 
described in <a 
href="http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/device-owners/2007-September/000490.html">this 
mailing list thread</a>.</p>

<p>Seth David Schoen brought up a good point: the press release mentions 
that they're Freeing their DRM implementation, too.  That silenced my 
excitement until I could learn more.</p>

<p>Here's a meaningless (in a formal sense) personal testimonial from 
the developer who says he did most of the porting of QTopia to the 
Neo:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;paulproteus> ljp, I saw that the announcement said you guys were GPLing your DRM implementation.
&lt;paulproteus> Does the binary you gave out include that DRM software?
&lt;ljp> not DRM, but SXE
&lt;ljp> and the neo does not configured with SXE
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>SXE is <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/sxe.html">an 
on-phone sandboxing system</a> for untrusted software, and the Neo 
doesn't use it anyway.  I feel safe enough that I can go to sleep, at 
least.</p>

<h3>Creative Commons needs someone good. If not me, then who? (2006)</h3>

<p>At the end of 2006, graduation was looming. I had to find a job.</p>

<p>The Johns Hopkins CS jobs emails seemed to list two kinds of work in the Baltimore
area: cutting-edge artificial intelligence research to build better killing machines
for defense contractors, and mind-numbing Java development jobs that
built expensive, hard-to-use websites for government agencies.</p>

<p>Faced with these options, I thought I'd ask Creative Commons if they wanted
to hire a software engineer. (I had just interned there the summer of 2006.) To my
glee and relief, they said, "Yes." In the blink of an eye, I said "Yes" back.</p>

<p>Then Google recruiters started emailing me. They suggested I apply to be
a Site Reliability Engineer. They needed people who
understood Linux-based performance issues and software architecture, could
critique other engineers' designs before they took code to production, and
be nimble system administrators. That sounded exactly like what I enjoyed doing.
But I told them I already had plans.</p>

<p>While having lunch at Wegmans, I explained this to my parents.</p>

<p>"You could at least <em>interview</em> with them," pleaded my mother.</p>

<p>"No," I explained. "Google has enough resources to find someone who will help it achieve its goals. Creative Commons doesn't necessarily."</p>

<p>The day-to-day work at Google would have been more technically challenging, but
my actions weren't going to make a net difference on the world. At CC, they would.</p>

<h3>My own projects also need that push (2009)</h3>

<p>In late April 2009, I was stunned to
<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/move-to-atlanta.html">learn</a> that Shotput Ventures funded
a project Nelson, Raffi, and I applied to start. It's now called <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>.</p>

<p>I had started working at Creative Commons because I wanted to push the world in that direction.
I had enough self-confidence to think that if it wasn't me coding for them (and promoting them),
it could be someone less effective.</p>

<p>In 2009, I realized that the same applied to my own projects. If there is a direction I want to
push the world, it's not going that way unless <em>I</em> push it.</p>

<p>Thus was one more layer of humility removed.</p>

<h3>This job will teach me skills I want -- on their time (2011)</h3>

<p>Recently, I've considered other ways to spend my time: for example, building a system administration co-op to 
combat corporate cloud services with freedom-loving humans, or organizing urban kitchens for hungry 
yuppies to practice cooking during their lunch breaks.</p>

<p>To understand how to make the sysadmin co-op succeed,
I needed to understand devops-style system automation tools. A few months ago, while working on
<a href="http://mirocommunity.org/">Miro Community</a>, I had the chance to redefine the service requirements
using <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/introduction/">Puppet</a>. Once I realized that it would
help me plan my own future, I lept at the task.</p>

<p>This year, it struck me that if a job can teach me something I want to know in order to
make my own projects succeed better, <em>that</em> could be a reason to take it. That includes
future projects, and goals with a timeline of 5-10 years.</p>

<p>Until recently, I thought
that jobs were devices for turning my time into some change in the world; I didn't realize I could
retain some of the value in the transaction.
In other words, I realized that I'm not an invisible worker pushing the world around. I'm a 
permanent fixture in my life.</p>

<p>Thus was removed one layer of self-effacement.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'll conclude with some advice to myself:</p>

<p>Don't forget about yourself. Not just your vision of the world; things like, What skills are you gaining? How does this job help you succeed at what you'll be doing five years from now?</p>

<p>I admit it, I use nano for text editing from time to time.  Like 
right now, with this post.<p>

<p>nano is a simple text editor widely derided as being simple.  It also 
has most of the features I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular expression find/replace</li>
<li>Fast loading</li>
<li>Automatic word wrap when you want it, and easily-disabled word wrap 
when you don't</li>
<li>No insane modal-ness like vi</li>
<li>Ability to easily insert the results of shell commands into 
files</li>
<li>Really easy to use with context help all the time</li>
<li>Real ultimate freedom</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Syntax highlighting?</h4>

<p>Yeah.  <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-86562.html">Some 
Gentoo dudes</a> pointed out it had it in 2003.  The nano changelog 
indicates (from a quick skimming) that version nano-1.1.4 - 12/11/2001 
was the first with "Preliminary syntax highlighting support".</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>

&lt;helix&gt; I think it got syntax highlighting around the same time

<p>When I explain to people what the MIT Mystery Hunt is, I usually give 
this example from 2004:</p>

<p>You are faced with a web page whose title is "Track 13" and that 
embeds an MP3 file.  The file is aobut 30 seconds long, and it seems to 
be two-second snippets from about 15 songs.  So you get a bunch of 
people together, and you identify the songs.  Once you write out the 
track titles, they look something like this:</p>

<pre>

<b>R</b>accoon Tail by Mario
<b>A</b>maze Me by Girlyman
<b>N</b>athan's Rise by Mozart
<b>K</b>atholic Kookies by Kristian At Heart
</pre>

<p>That is, the first column spells out "ORDER LYRIC CLIPS BY RANK".  So 
now you have to figure out the lyric clips that you've been hearing, 
which takes even more collaboration and Googling, and once you do, you 
stare at it, trying to figure out an order until someone comes by and 
says, "Hey, <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> just released their top songs 
list this year."  So you order it by that and you get the name of some 
band, followed by "NOT DON".</p>

<p>As luck has it, everyone in that band (according to All Music Guide) 
had the letters "DON" in their name, except for one guy.  So you call in 
his last name as the answer, and you move on.  We did all this in the 
Bio Lab of ESG.</p>

<p>In the 2007 hunt, we had a new music puzzle!  We began to work on it 
in the Bio Lab of ESG!  But when I asked if anyone remembered "Track 13" 
or worked on it, they all had blank faces.</p>

<p>Maybe the explanation is not that I'm old.  After all, there are 
veterans on the team who have been there since I joined them.  But it 
struck me as evidence of a generation boundary, which saddened me, 
especially in my last year at Hopkins where most of my good 
friends had already graduated.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>My friend Venkatesh, pictured above, is going to bike four thousand miles, all the way across the continental US, from Baltimore to Portland. He's doing it to raise money for the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults. I'm writing this because I want you to <a href="http://4kforcancer.org/profiles/venkatesh-srinivas/">donate money to his cause</a>. He's a DragonFly BSD developer, loves bikes, and your donation could make a big difference.</p>
<p>I first met Venkatesh through the Johns Hopkins computer club, an <a href="http://acm.jhu.edu/">ACM chapter</a>. I was the head of the club, and he had just started his career at Hopkins. He was looking for advice on running <a href="http://brickwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">Brickwiki</a>, the LEGO encyclopedia. Quickly, I became his friend; in that time, I've learned the following things about him.</p>
<ul>
<li>He is friendly!</li>
<li>He believes in science; beyond just writing <a href="http://ops101.org/">sharp code</a>, he likes to <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hackers/2010-December/033864.html">ask</a> <a href="http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2011-03/msg00016.html">questions</a>.</li>
<li>He is melodramatically attracted to the power and complexity of biology. (The above quote about cancer are his words.)</li>
<li>He wants to do something to make cancer less of a killer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the years since I graduated from Hopkins, I've been impressed by Venkatesh's ongoing curiosity and contributions to open source projects like DragonFly. I'm honored to have this chance to help him bike across the country for a good cause.</p>
<p>Here is a quick word about the <a href="http://4kforcancer.org/">4K for cancer</a> effort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2002, groups of college students have undertaken a 70 day,  4000+ mile summer bike ride across the United States with the goal of  offering hope, inspiration and support to cancer communities along the  way.</p>
<p>This past summer was our 10th year of cycling across the country as  76 volunteers rode along three different routes:  Baltimore to San  Francisco, Baltimore to Portland, and Baltimore to Seattle.  Our riders  raised a combined $476,000 to support organizations and individuals in  the fight against cancer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His fundraising goal is $5,000. Anything from $5 to $500 is a donation to an organization that helps young adult cancer surviers and their families get access to information and support resources. <a href="http://4kforcancer.org/profiles/venkatesh-srinivas/">Can you help</a>? </p>

<p>On <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2011/schedule#day_2011_06_24">Friday, June 24</a>, the last day of <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2011/schedule">Open Source Bridge</a>, I won a scarf! It says, "Open Source Citizen."</p>

<p>I wasn't the only one. The attendees nominated people who "<a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/blog/2011/06/wrapping-up-2011/">made an extra effort to help others and share their knowledge</a>," and the conference committee chose the three people they felt exemplified this. The winners were <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana Harihareswara</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/igalko">Igal Koshevoy</a>, and me.</p>

<p>In case you don't know Sumana, she's the new Wikimedia <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Staff">Volunteer Development Coordinator</a>, a friend, and a commenter <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/indians.html">here</a> <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon-2010.html">at</a> Asheeshworld. In the photo of her and her new scarf, you can also see Ward Cunningham. I suggest reading her <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2011/07/10/0">wrap-up</a> about the conference, and checking out the <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/2011/wiki/Learn_Tech_Management_In_45_Minutes">notes from her talk</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't met Igal, but I've learned he's a fixture of the Portland tech scene. He's <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/users/1">user number one</a> on opensourcebridge.org and one of the original contributors to <a href="http://calagator.org/">calagator</a>, the most important event calendar in the Portland tech world. That's just a brief summary; follow <a href="http://twitter.com/igalko">him on Twitter</a> to keep in touch.</p>

<p>I started the conference a little shy, not wanting to introduce myself to people, so I hung out with Sumana. She talked to everyone she could find, and there I was standing next to her. On the first day, it was only because of Sumana's outgoingness that people knew who I was. On the second and third days, I was involved in two sessions: a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/711">panel on open source communities</a> and a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/705">talk about the OpenHatch training missions</a>.</p>

<p>I was extremely honored to be chosen. There were so many other spectacular people I met for the first time, like <a href="http://valerieaurora.org/">Valerie Aurora</a>, 
<a href="http://twitter.com/jarichaust">Jacinta Richardson</a>, <a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/">Brian Aker</a>, and <a href="http://alexlinsker.com/">Alex Linsker</a>. These are all people with three crucial traits: they're <em>extremely</em> knowledgeable, friendly, and opinionated. I'm glad I had a chance to attend and meet them!</p>

<p><em>Photo credits</em>: Thanks to <a href="http://wiki.mako.cc/Noah_Swartz">Noah Swartz</a> for the photo of me. Sumana's photo comes from <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical/54396">her post to wikitech-l</a>.

</p>
<p>Three weekends ago, I participated in a <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp">Debian bug squashing party</a>. It was more fun than I had guessed!</p>
<p>The event worked: we squashed bugs. Geoffrey Thomas (geofft) organized it as an event for MIT's student computing group, SIPB. In this post, I'll review the good parts and the bad. I'll conclude with beaming photos of my two mentees and talk about the bugs they fixed.</p>
<p>So, the good:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Attendance</strong>. As <a href="https://luke.faraone.cc/">Luke</a> put it, when he arrived, there was hardly anyone there.  “Then people showed up! And then mentorship and pedagogy happened!” In all, 14 people attended, seven of whom are active in Debian or its derivatives (Ubuntu, Debathena).</li>
<li><strong>We took photos</strong>. Arthur took a wide panoramic photo, and I snapped a few good ones, too. (Thanks to Jessica McKellar for letting me borrow her camera.) Here's my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulproteus/sets/72157627510089068/with/6076878743/">full photo set</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Good, free pizza</strong>. Props to geofft for ordering from <a href="http://beautys-pizza.com/">Beauty's</a>, and props to SIPB for picking up the tab.</li>
<li><strong>We fixed bugs</strong>! I mentored two new Debian contributors through their first release-critical bug fix. Both of them said they would attend similar events in the future. One of my mentees is now idling and asking questions in the #debian-mentors IRC channel.</li>
<li><strong>The Debian Events team republished the event</strong>. MadameZou <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp">posted</a> the event to debian.org, giving it a nice stable URL.</li>
<li><strong>geofft made a good list of bugs to work on</strong>. He worked from the release-critical bug list, categorized the bugs by expected difficulty, and made somee short notes about how to fix the bug. This turned out quite useful.</li>
<li><strong>People printed music to the speakers</strong>. If this sounds weird, you should read the <a href="http://sipb.mit.edu/doc/using-sipbmp3/">SIPB documentation for how to use Gutenbach</a> (written by <a href="http://lizdenys.com/">Liz Denys</a>).</li>
<li><strong>We had a good ratio of developers to newcomers</strong>. This was hugely helpful; from what I saw, new people rarely waited very long for their questions to be answered. Thanks to Luke Faraone, Sam Hartman, Obey Arthur Liu, Karl Ramm, and Christine Spang from Debian, and Geoffrey Thomas from Debathena, for sharing knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event was a success, but as always, there are some things that could have gone more smoothly. Here's that list:</p>
<ul><li><strong>We hadn't prepared for people to do Debian development on Ubuntu</strong>. In particular, it took Luke and me about half an hour to come up with a pbuilder command line that worked.</li>
<li><strong>We didn't contribute to Ubuntu, just Debian</strong>. I actually think this is fine, but geofft did originally <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp">want people to work on both</a>. He was disappointed, and we could have managed to do that if we had done more prep.</li>
<li><strong>We could have reached more prospective attendees</strong>. I know earlier in the year, <a href="http://rhydd.org/">daf</a> organized a highly popular Debian packaging tutorial <a href="http://pika.mit.edu/">elsewhere on campus</a>. I didn't see any of those people at the event, and I think some would have attended if they had known about it.</li>
<li><strong>Some people wanted a bit more context</strong>. In particular, attendees asked me about what makes a bug release-critical and what it means to do a non-maintainer upload. We could have taken some time to explain these to the whole group; instead, we dove right into hacking. Because we had so many mentors, I think people did get their questions answered, but we can't sustain that if the event grows in size.</li>
<li><strong>Mentees didn't always get high-quality help</strong>. geofft suggested Jessica work on one bug, and when she had a question, she asked Luke Faraone. Luke wasn't familiar with the bug, and he skimmed it, not realizing that the bug changed issues midway through the bug log. As a result, his initial help was unhelpful. After Luke, Jessica, and the bug were on the same page (so to speak), Jessica received clear, sound answers to questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it turned out well! I did three NMUs, corresponding to three patches submitted for release-critical bugs by my two mentees. Those mentees were:</p>
<p><img src="//asheesh.org/pub/image/debian-bsp/6076850459_b49d2fb456.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Jessica enjoying herself" /></p>
<p><a href="http://jesstess.com/">Jessica McKellar</a> is a software engineer at <strike>Ksplice</strike> Oracle and a recent graduate of MIT's EECS program. She solved three release-critical bugs. This was her first direct contribution to Debian. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no&bug=636201">#636201</a>:  While updating the package for multiarch support, the maintainer of  wildmidi presumably made a typo. A single character was missing from a  "Replaces:" declaration in debian/control. This bug caused upgrades to  fail. Sam Hartman uploaded an NMU based on a patch Jessica  prepared.</li>
<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626420">#626420</a>: The scribus-doc package failed to build from source due to a missing build-depends entry. This one was super easy, and served as a good test package for setting up and using pbuilder.</li>
<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=565000">#565000</a>: The switch to 
gcc-4.5 left hubbub unable to build from source due to new GCC warnings that made -Wall fail on the source, although it would succeed with earlier versions of the package. This led to long philosophical discussions about the particularly most reasonable fix: removing -Wall, or adding a more specific exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jessica has since gotten involved in the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~twisted-dev/+archive/ppa">Twisted project's personal package archive</a>. Toward the end of the sprint, she explained, "I like fixing bugs. I will totally come to the next bug squashing party."</p>
<p><img height="500" width="281" alt="Noah grinning" src="//asheesh.org/pub/image/debian-bsp/6077392890_95567b4bd3.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.mako.cc/Noah_Swartz">Noah Swartz</a> is a recent graduate of Case Western Reserve University  where he studied Mathematics and played Magic. He is an intern at the MIT Media Lab where he contributes to <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/doppellab/">DoppelLab</a> in Joe Paradiso's <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/responsive-environments">Responsive Environments</a> group. This was definitely his first direct contribution to Debian. It was also one of the most intense command-line experiences he has had so far. Noah wasn't originally planning to come, but we were having lunch together before the hackathon, and I convinced him to join us.</p>
<p>Noah fixed <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625177">#625177</a>, a fails-to-build-from-source (FTBFS) bug in nslint. The problem was that "-Wl" was instead written in all lowercase in the debian/rules file, as "-wl". Noah fixed that, making sure the package properly built in pbuilder, and then spent some quality time with lintian figuring out the right way to write a debian/changelog.</p>
<p>That's a wrap! We'll hopefully have one again in a few months, and before that, I hope to write up a guide so that we run things even more smoothly next time.</p>

<p>The beautiful photo above is what reflections should look like. If you don't like Google's shimmering +1 buttons, try the <a href="http://blog.tommorris.org/post/7039918552/1-and-google-no-thanks-fuck-off">convenient AdBlock filter Tom Morris wrote</a>.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 440px;"><p style="margin-top: 1em;">I have been reading a lot about Google+. I'm sure a lot of people put a lot of hard work into it. Lots of people seem to enjoy using it and appreciate its features. For my part, right now, when I see Google+ mentioned, the smile vanishes from my face.</p>

<p>I just have a few thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>It's anti-competitive.</strong> If you could ask Google, "How much for a shimmering +1 button next to every search result?" you would be laughed out of the room. But they managed to offer themselves that unique marketing opportunity. I know that (1) most regulators who see this anti-competitive behavior won't see it as an anti-trust violation, and (2) the damage is already done, and no retribution in the future can act fast enough to fix the unfair advantage Google gave itself in the Internet-mediated personal communication (and ad sales) markets.</p>

<p><strong>The shimmering is distracting, making my online search experience worse.</strong> I know that Google is holding nothing back; they are willing to distract me from my intended use of Google in order to branch out their business. (If you haven't seen the shimmering +1 button, it's next to every web search result, and if you mouse over <em>any</em> part of the result, it does a wavy dance.)</p>

<p><strong>The most-touted feature is a clone of Diaspora.</strong> This by itself is fine; software should help users by having the best features imaginable. But the enthusiasm I've seen within the free software community (like when I read about Google+ on Slashdot and Planet Debian) should at least <em>recognize</em> that Google "circles" are a <a href="http://raventools.com/blog/google-copies-diaspora/">clone of Diaspora's Aspects</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Centralization on the web feels like a personal attack.</strong> Corporations on the web are like unstoppable machines rolling us toward a future of corporate eavesdropping, central points of failure, and end-users sold en masse to advertisers. It enables a future of individual "platform owners" who can change the lived experience of untold hundreds of millions with tweaks that benefit their actual customers (the advertisers). There's not much I can do about that. I happen to take this personally: I am part of a small culture of people who run their own mail and web servers and understand the importance of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">software freedom</a>. This is a part of my identity. I watch as its traces online vanish, replaced by something more efficient and terrifying. It <a href="http://makesad.us/">makes me sad</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'm probably going to end up using it despite all these pain points.</strong> That's how I know that I am being steamrolled. The reasons I have given above are not reasons to <em>not use</em> Google+. They're just reasons that I'm going to frown all the way to the address bar.</p>

<p>In weeks to months to years, the service will grow an enthusiastic userbase. At that point, personally, I'll have to make a choice between connecting with those people on their terms, or not staying in touch with them. Already, professionally, the idea has already come up on <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">#openhatch</a> that Google+ could help us reach people willing to contribute to open source. Are my gripes worth holding OpenHatch back, or worth isolating myself over? Probably not.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/what-are-you-avoiding-working-on/">Cross-posted from the OpenHatch blog</a>.)</p>
                <p>I remember working on my first big group programming project back in college. The project involved some web scraping work; I enthusiastically took charge of that part. But a few weeks in, my code just wasn’t working. I felt frustrated and helpless — I’m supposed to be the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/preso/pycon-2010.html">scraping expert</a>, so why couldn’t I fix the problems? I retreated into hiding and didn’t want to think about the group of people or the project.</p>

<p>A week later, I feebly ran <tt>svn update</tt> to see how the project had progressed. “Oh!” I exclaimed to myself. “Someone made the data importer work!” I felt a rush of relief.&nbsp;(While writing this paragraph, I sighed again remembering it.)</p>
<p>When I talked to my teammate George, he mentioned off-handedly&nbsp;that he had fixed it. He didn’t feel any of the anguish I felt or&nbsp;assign me the blame I thought I deserved. I guess if I had just asked&nbsp;for help earlier, I could have skipped the feelings of inadequacy entirely&nbsp;and George would have just fixed the bug.</p>
<p>Half a decade later,&nbsp;I feel the same dread about&nbsp;<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=405762">the lack of Maildir support</a> in Alpine. The bug is three years old! Ugh.</p>

<p>This time, I’m going to ask for help. So I listed the issue on <a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/alpine">the Alpine project page on OpenHatch</a>.&nbsp;To put it there, here’s what I did:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Go to the <a href="https://openhatch.org/+projects/">OpenHatch projects list</a> and enter your project&#8217;s name. That will take to your project page.</li> 
<li>Answer the last question, &#8220;What is a bug or issue that you&#8217;ve been putting off, neglecting, or just plain avoiding?&#8221;</li> 
<li>Hit <strong>submit</strong>! We&#8217;ll help you sign in with your Google account or other OpenID.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For those of you who work on Free Software projects, what are the issues that drain <em>you</em> the same way?</p>
<p>No bug tracker I’ve seen has a field that says, “I’m avoiding working on this, and that sucks.” To say <em>that</em>, list the issue on your project’s OpenHatch page.</p>
<p>So join in! What are the issues you don’t want to think about? Once you share them, maybe a fellow developer or a new contributor will come by and help you out.</p>
<p><a href="https://openhatch.org/">Head to OpenHatch</a> and let the world know.</p>
<p>P.S. Do you have any ideas about how we can make these project pages more useful? Let <a href="https://openhatch.org/contact/">us</a> know!</p>

<p>P.P.S. Dear Joey Hess and everyone else, sorry that Alpine still doesn’t have Maildir support.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>
At the start of the summer, I read an article by a journalist who 
successfully worked for his U.S.-based company while wandering South 
America for a month.  No one knew that when he interviewed them over 
Skype, he said, he was thousands of miles away.
<p>

<p>That sounded pretty good, so I wanted to try it.  I was invited to 
speak on behalf of Science Commons, and Herbert had been to Japan but I 
hadn't, so I thought that this trip to Tokyo would be a good one to 
start with.  Some basic notes (more later, hopefully):</p>

<ul>
<li>Weekends are really useful.  If you're working in the daytime, 
you'll miss out on lots of great things that can only happen in the 
afternoon.</li>
<li>You'll miss people from home.  Some of them might miss you too, but 
you'll have less way of knowing that.</li>
<li>Plans are useful.  Guide books that have walking tours with lists of 
places to go, marked on the map of the walking tours, are immensely 
helpful.</li>
<li>Seeing people takes time.  If you're lucky (or if you're smart), you 
can arrange to see people in places you actually wanted to go in the 
first place.  Maybe you can do what I'm doing today, which is 
(hopefully) seeing an act of a Kabuki play somewhere before 
meeting up with people, or maybe you can manage to chat with 
people as you walk through some nice park.  Otherwise, be 
aware that 
you're adding to the places you 
have to go see.
</li>
<li>Speaking French is fun, and it's one of the few activities 
where if people compliment you don't have to feel bad
accepting the compliment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just before and after committing to my plane tickets, as I remarked 
that I was leaving Tokyo on a Saturday, I wondered, Maybe I should 
extend this so I have the weekend in Tokyo.  The big lesson from this 
trip is, Yes, you need weekends.  You weren't really able to use 
the weekend of the conference, and you could have predicted as much way 
earlier.

a service where they'll receive mail on my behalf and, if I want them to, scan it. And if there
is a check inside, they'll send it to my bank's "Deposit by mail" address so it gets
into my bank account.</p>

<p>I've been using it for a number of OpenHatch inbound mail things, so that I
don't have to go deposit checks at a bank branch if e.g. I'm traveling. But I've
also been using it for a few personal things.</p>

<p>I suspect this is a wedding invitation. I've clicked the "Open and Scan" button
in the website, and expect to find out shortly (in 1-24 hours).</p>

<p>John Wilbanks from <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science 
Commons</a> asked me to give a talk about the Neurocommons project on 
SC's behalf in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Monday evening, as I was sitting in the CC office wondering what to 
work on next, I decided I would put all my papers in order and update my 
calendar so I would have precise notes about which of the many email 
attachment I'd need to refer to at which time.   I wasn't leaving until 
Wednesday, but I figured I'd need to do this sometime.</p>

<p>That's when I learned that I was actually leaving 
<strong>Tuesday</strong>, not Wednesday.  The only reason I made my 
flight is because I procrastinated real work with organizational work.  
The shock from that realization lasted for pretty much the twelve hours 
that followed it.</p>

<p>But right now, I'm in an airplane that will soon land in Tokyo.  I'll 
be <a 
href="http://kashiwaio.dir.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/workshop03.html">presenting</a> 
on Thursday, and attending the rest of the conference Friday and 
Saturday, and then I plan to sort of hang out in Japan for a week 
(ingeniously, I'll work remotely, so I can hang out in Japan without 
using precious vacation time).  So if you want to hang out, or if you 
want to tell me what to do / where to eat / who to meet, drop me a <a 
href="mailto:japan@asheesh.org">line</a>!</p>

<p>I'll probably get a cell phone for the time that I'm here (apparently 
the Japanese aren't really into GSM, so I'll have to rent a real local 
one), and presumably I'll post its number when I have it.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where I'll sleep and bathe after the conference, 
it's in <a

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/politics/contact%20congress.html">Contacting Congress</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say Alan, a regular citizen with no income (at least, that's 
who I was a few months ago) has a website. Let's say I'm agitated about 
some issue of national concern, and I want to get my readers to contact 
their Congresscritter.  Let's say those readers don't even know who they 
elected.  How do they do it?  That person is missing two crucial pieces 
of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who the Senator or Representative is, and</li>
<li>how to contact that person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shouldn't the information of which parts of the country are 
represented by be information anyone can use to promote democratic 
engatement?</p>

<p>Okay, so the Senator name is easy - those are two per state, easy to 
look up.  And f you look at the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of 
Representatives</a> website, they let you put in your ZIP code and tell 
you who represents you.  If house.gov needs more information, it will 
ask.</p>

<p>But that only tells you <em>who</em>, not <em>how</em>.  Different 
Congress-people want to be contacted in different ways - phone, web 
form, or email.  It would be nice to have a publicly-available database 
of that.  But who will do the hard work to maintain it?  And if it's a 
web form, then those are different on a per-representatve basis.  And 
when Bob uses Alan's website to contact his member of Congress, 
Alan would prefer to that Bob always see Alan's page templates, advice 
for what to put in the fields, and so on.  So this information should be 
not only available, it should be machine-usable.</p>

<h3>A proposal</h3>

<p>So here's a proposal for how to maintain this information:</p>

<p>First of all, a technical note: All the data extraction described 
below can either be done by a central server that is asked every time 
someone wants to know, or client-side code that runs on Bob's 
computer/browser that does the extraction.  The advantage of the latter 
is that it's much harder to block as well as more impressive in the 
server logs at house.gov.</p>

<h4>Who's my Rep or Senator?</h4>

<p>It is always going to be easy (in a technical sense) to determine 
which field on <a href="http://www.house.gov/">house.gov</a> is the ZIP 
code entry field.  (If Bob doesn't know his ZIP, you can just look it up 
with e.g. the USPS website.)  The responses will be easy to parse, too; 
just see, of the results returned, which ones actually are a known 
possible choice according to e.g. Wikipedia.</p>

<h4>How do I contact him/her?</h4>

<p>All Senators and Representatives do provide web forms.  In general 
they have a common set of fields, and then some have more advanced ones.  
The central component is just listing which form fields are required; 
Bob's computer/web browser can just dynamically create a form that 
matches, all within the look of Bob's site.</p>

<p>If you want to store the results for performance reasons, you don't 
have to worry about storing it for every possible location or 
representative.  Just cache it once a client requests for about a day, 
I'd say.</p>

<h4>What about reliability?</h4>

<p>What to do if the House of Representatives website (or its form 
handling) is not online at the moment?  Recall there are two ways to 
architect the form submission: Either Bob's computer could directly 
submit to the form on his representative's web site, or he could submit 
to a central computer that would do all the submissions.  The advantage 
of the latter is that the central computer can enqueue form submissions 
that were problematic just like mail servers queue email.</p>

<p>In fact, the same strategy could be used for the form itself!  
Imagine that Bob wants to submit to his rep's web form but house.gov is 
unavailable.  If the central server doesn't have the form cached, then 
at least

<h3>Why go through all this trouble?</h3>

<p>Well, as a public service.  It would be nice if anyone could run 
their own Action Alert site without having to pay or otherwise submit to 
the will of third parties.</p>

<h3>Exactly how much trouble is it?</h3>

<p>As I've described it, the whole system is automated.  Optionally, a 
human can call representatives and see how they like to be contacted.  
If each conversation takes about five minutes, and there are fewer than 
600 Senators and Representatives, it takes only 3,000 minutes or 50 
man-hours tops to contact everyone and ask their preferred means of 
contact.  This can be done in one shot, or it could be done by 
volunteers spread across the country.</p>

<p>Now, it would be <strong>really interesting</strong> to apply this on 
a state level.  Cheap and widely-used action alerts to state 
senators would make for much more interest from state legislatures 
in what their constituents think....</p>

<p>Some notes on American Fascism:</p>

<ul>
<li>People say this: 

"This kid got to say his piece, and then started ranting, the police 
TRIED (leila take note here) to escort him out calmly but he resisted 
and continued ranting. This is the sort of behavior that can incite a 
riot" when a kid is being tasered for asking a question and being a 
brat.

</li><li>But what are we to do when mainstream pre-Presidential 
candidate Rudy Giuliani is <a

Friedman is for <a

       </h1>
		
<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Inbox Zero</a> suggests 
keeping my INBOX to having zero items in it.  Recently I received an 
email that was informative rather than had information I needed to act 
on, and it struck me: Why <em>do</em> I use my INBOX as an archive?</p>

<p>So I'm going to try this idea out.  (I first heard of it while 
surfing <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a>.)  I've 
been using IMAP labels in (al)pine in a similar fashion to the way 
Merlin Mann suggests using email, but the big difference is that when an 
email is dealt with, I don't make it visually go away.  So sometimes 
I dig through INBOX to see what I forgot to deal with.</p>

<p>I actually found the Inbox Zero web site very hard to use.  Here are 
the lessons I've extracted so far:</p>

<h3>INBOX is a place emails go before you act on them</h3>

<p>The <a 
href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/02/18/quick-tips-on-processing-your-email-inbox/">available 
action space is</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>delete (Okay, I'm not going to do that)</li>
<li>archive (>90% of my mail is informative rather than actionable)</li>
<li>defer (save to reply-to-me for later sprints)</li>
<li>generate an action from it (save to act-on-me for later sprints)</li>
<li>reply right now (if it'll take <2 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disable auto-check</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/15/email-dash/">"Are you 
checking the email, Yakov, or is it checking you?"</a></p>

<p>This means both disabling my instinct to auto-check as well as the 
technology that auto-checks every minute.  Every 30m or 60m is okay.  
I'm not quite sure what to do about the system monitoring alerts, 
though.</p>

<h3>Do email in dashes</h3>

<p>Defragment the day; see the Yakov link above.</p>

<p>My laptop feels slow.  Having run no metrics, I'm going to guess a 
lot of the reason that apt-get takes more than a second or two to load 
its database is the seek time of the hard drive.  It's some boring 5400 
RPM sucker, and it has moving parts which have to move.  Totally 
lame.</p>

<p>So I'll replace it with flash of some kind.  Flash is expensive for 
lots of space, so it's probably wasteful of dollars to make it my /home 
partition.  But if / were fast, then at least apt and application 
launching would be faster.  And swap would be faster in a world where 
seeks are almost free, too.</p>

<h3>Solid State Disk, or CF card</h3>

<p>Here are the contenders in pre-packaged solid state land:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.transcendusa.com/Products/ModDetail.asp?ModNo=164">
Transcend's solid-state hard drives</a>. Unfortunately no one on 
products.google.com seems to have these in stock.
</li><li>

<a 
href="http://www.sandisk.com/OEM/ProductCatalog(1274)-SanDisk_SSD_Solid_State_Drives.aspx">
SanDisk SSD (formerly FFD) UATA 2.5”</a>.  Apparently these are an OEM-only part.
</li></ul>

<p>So it's off to CompactFlash cards then.  Cards compatible with the 
CompactFlash 4.0 spec can do Ultra DMA mode 4, which I don't even 
remember how many megabytes a second but it should be fast.  The cards 
themselves should be fast, too; no point putting a slow card on a fast 
bus.  It looks like Transcend's 8GB TS8GCF266 is the best in 
price-performance, around $140.</p>

<h3>What about the flash media dying tragically and abruptly?</h3>

<p>It's true, flash media have a maximum number of writes they can take 
before tragedy.  Hopefully things will be fine; <a 
href="http://www.transcendusa.com/Products/ModDetail.asp?ModNo=148&SpNo=3&LangNo=0">Transcend's 
specifications</a> seem to say has "1 000 000 times" endurance, which 
presumably means writes.  And consumer-grade Flash cards do <a

from what I hear.</p>

<p>Emily Clough asks sharp questions.</p>
<p>Academically speaking, Emily <a href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/emily-clough">is</a> a doctoral candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard. She studies comparative politics and the political economy of development with a special research focus on private governance and child labor. But this is a personal story, written to celebrate <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>In 2007, I had just graduated from college and was working for Creative Commons as a programmer. I was awed by my sudden position near the center of a whirlwhind of copyright activism; at the same time, I wondered about what kind of impact the <a href="http://freeculture.org/">free culture movement</a> was making. Were we really empowering people? How many? Which ones?</p>
<p>For Thanksgiving Day 2007, I was planning to be on a flight to New Delhi to visit some family. The night before, I stayed up all night chatting with <a href="http://abhay.tumblr.com/">Abhay</a>, expecting to sleep on the plane. When I got to the airport, I discovered I didn't have a visa for India in my passport. Groggy and confused, I managed to visit the consulate and get a new visa.</p>
<p>So on Thanksgiving evening, a day usually filled with family and feasts, I had no plans. I explained this to my roommate Matt Baggott, and he invited me to a vegan Thanksgiving dinner hosted by his friend <a href="http://www.maenad.net/">Nori Heikkinen</a>. That was where I met Emily Clough.</p>
<p>Emily was interested in international development, and I told her about the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/License">activity</a> I was making to teach kids about Creative Commons. This was November 2007, and like much of the tech world, I was excited about <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a>. OLPC was creating inexpensive, highly-interactive learning computers to distribute to children all over the developing world. They would have free software on them, which kids could edit, and my activity was going to maybe ship with them.</p>
<p>Emily, ever thoughtfully critical, wondered about the possibility of gender bias.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emily: "How are they identifying which children get computers?"</p>
<p>Asheesh: "I think they ask schools to go through their rosters and ask for that many computers."</p>
<p>Emily: "Don't you think that under-privileges girls?"</p>
<p>Asheesh: "I don't see why it would."</p>
<p>Emily: "It's an empirical question. Girls are under-represented on school rosters in much of the developing world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Huh</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Emily's remark taught me that the effects of sexism can be magnified if we act unaware of it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I work on <a href="https://openhatch.org/">growing the free software community</a>. What I want is user empowerment.</p>
<p>I spend much of that time organizing <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/scala-crash-course.html">events</a> to <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop">address</a> gender diversity issues in free software. When growing the free software community, it's not enough to find more contributors; we have to make sure we're reaching people of all kinds. Gender is one place where there's still work to be done.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>Today I'd like to quote a passage from one of my favorite books,
<a href="http://open-advice.org/">Open Advice</a>, edited by the astounding
<a href="http://lydiapintscher.de/">Lydia Pintscher</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to quote it because someone helped me with a technical problem today,
and today was definitely a day when I needed it.</p>

<p>This passage is written by Rich Bowen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humility</p>

<p>I had been doing technical support, particularly on mailing lists, for
about two years, when I first started attending technical conferences.
Those first few years were a lot of fun. Idiots would come onto a
mailing list, and ask a stupid question that a thousand other losers
had asked before them. If they had taken even two minutes to just
look, they would have found all the places the question had been
answered before. But they were too lazy and dumb to do that.</p>

<p>Then I attended a conference, and discovered a few things.</p>

<p>First, I discovered that the people asking these questions were
people. They were not merely a block of monospaced black text on
a white background. They were individuals. They had kids. They
had hobbies. They knew so much more than I did about a whole
range of things. I met brilliant people for whom technology was a
tool to accomplish something non-technical. They wanted to share
their recipes with other chefs. They wanted to help children in west
Africa learn how to read. They were passionate about wine, and
wanted to learn more. They were, in short, smarter than I am, and
my arrogance was the only thing between them and further success.</p>

<p>When I returned from that first conference, I saw the users mailing
list in an entirely different light. These were no longer idiots asking
stupid questions. These were people who needed just a little bit of
my help so that they could get a task done, but, for the most part,
their passions were not technology. Technology was just a tool. So if
they did not spend hours reading last year’s mailing list archives, and
chose instead to ask the question afresh, that was understandable.</p>

<p>And, surely, if on any given day it is irritating to have to help
them, the polite thing to do is to step back and let someone else
handle the question, rather than telling them what an imbecile they
are. And, too, to remember all of the times I have had to ask the
stupid questions.</p>

<p>Mark Pilgrim wrote a lot a year or so ago about his switching from Mac 
OS X to GNU/Linux.  One small bit says:</p>

<blockquote><a 
href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">if 
I bought a new Mac, I would be subsidizing the development of an 
operating system that contains code whose sole purpose is to lock me 
into a specific hardware platform. I realize that most people don’t look 
at it that way, but there it is.</a></blockquote>

<p>This is as good a start as any to the MMM section of asheesh.org.  I 
currently have a full-time job, and in this world, when you fund 
something, you are voting with your dollars for that thing's continued 
existence.  That's as true for Apple's lock-in technology as it is for 
AT&T's illegal wiretapping program.</p>

<p>I claim to think that consumer freedom is important, that software 
freedoms are important, and that the environment is worth saving rather 
than trashing.  In that case, if I'm ethical or at least not a 
hypocrite, I should put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>I read a few years ago about some remarks by some guy at some open 
source software conference.  A young-looking dude wearing a suit and a 
weird expression and holding his arm <a 
href="http://luke.francl.org/lessig-challenge/">asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote> How many people have given to EFF more money than they have 
given to their local telecom to give them shitty DSL service? See? Four. 
How many people have given more money to EFF than they give each year to 
support the monopoly--to support the other side? </blockquote>

<p>(For context, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a non-profit 
whose sole focus is legal and lobbying action to protect digital 
rights.)</p>

<p>For years, I had been thinking in terms of this challenge, but I knew 
I didn't have the kind of income and spending money where my actions 
would be substantial.  In fact, I was in a tough spot like lots of 
people with very litle money: You have needs, and then wants, then 
somewhere hazy after that there's a planet to think of.</p>

<p>Well, now I'm a rich man - I have a job that pays me 
<em>thousands</em> of dollars every year.  Those thousands of dollars 
get to go somewhere, and I get to pick.  (Later on I would learn that 
this guy <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lessig</a> who raised this 
issue was an interesting guy in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#39">other ways</a>.)</p>

<p>When you vote with your dollars that a movie industry that sues its 
customers should continue existing, or when you vote with your dollars 
to Microsoft that their illegal tactics are okay, your dollars will turn 
around and be used (quite literally) to oppress others.  I say, not in 
my name.</p>

<p>As Mark Pilgrim noted: "[M]ost people don’t look at it that way, but 
there it is."  I'm creating this section to make sure there's a record in 
public that I started down this path so, if I ever want to abandon it, I 
can see how far I've come.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/reverse%20smileys.html">Reverse smileys</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>Kristian Hermansen sent an email to the San Francisco Linux Users 
Group list expressing <a 
href="http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/sf-lug/2007q4/002290.html">shock</a> 
at my "reverse smileys".  Others have, too, so let me take a moment to 
explain.<p>

<p>Some time around 1995, I started using AOL.  (I also stopped some 
time in the same century.)  I learned important vocabulary like "a/s/l" 
and "rofl" and PC Magazine sent me a free mousepad with Windows 95 
hotkeys like "Windows+R" for the Run dialog box.  Then our free month 
expired, and we went on to some other network.</p>

<p>Eventually I got into IM, and I started messaging friends routinely.  
I got into the habit of making complicated smileys - my favorite was Abe 
Lincoln: <tt> =|:-)=</tt> [<a 
href="http://www.eff.org/Net_culture/Folklore/Arts/smiley.list">source</a>]. 
And some time later on, the smileys started getting turned into 
pictures. It may have been cool that :-) turned into a picture of a <a 
href="http://tmbw.net/wiki/When_It_Rains_It_Snows">smiling yellow 
face</a>, but I found it offensive that (a) they (AOL) started doing 
this without asking me, on other people's computers, so I had no idea 
how my emoticon was going to be displayed, and (b) that they would 
totally corrupt smileys like Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>So I retaliated.  I came up with two counter-attacks.  The first was 
the smartest: :<em>-</em>) would not get graphicalized, I realized.  
(View the source if it's not clear how that works.)  That worked fine in 
media where I had rich formatting (HTML), but would fail me in emails.  
It was great for confusing my IMees, for whom it looked like a regular, 
old-school smiley, except all the other old-school smileys had gone away 
in favor of yellow circles with black lines and points.</p>

<p>The other way was more drastic and, instead of hiding between the 
lines, vocally made the point that not all smileys needed to be 
graphicalized.  That was to reverse the smiley.  I don't know when I 
started doing that, but it's probably some time between 1998 and 
2000.</p>

<p>I also liked to abuse smileys to make grinning asides in emails.  (-; 
You might wonder why asides needed to grin; usually they wink instead! 
;-)  I don't know if that idea came before or after I started making 
backwards smileys in the first place. I don't do this as much now in 
large part to me having seen Thunderbird turn my closing smileys into 
lame yellow things that ruin the symmetry.</p>

<p>One day during <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/">natural 
language processing</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Jason 
Eisner</a> said in class that he thought people who did the above thing 
(presumably without knowing I did it) were making an NLP joke.  That 
added to the feeling that NLP was right up my alley.</p>

<p>All in all, smileys have been a big part of my online life.  It's 
only fitting that the EFF and They Might Be Giants contributed to 
this post.</p>

<p>For the first time in what feels like years, I wanted to share
something with my friends on Facebook.
</p><p>The background was that I read a note on Slashdot that Linus Torvalds thought
a presidential candidate's remarks on a topic related to airline security were
"moron"ic. So I did my own research, and I disagreed. I figured this was a topic
of general enough interest that all my Facebook friends might be interested in
knowing my position, so I wanted to share that.
</p><p>Facebook didn't let me.
</p><p>I tried first with a link to snopes.com, which blocked me with the
rationale that http://snopes.com/images/template/snopes.gif is "spammy
or unsafe":
</p><p><img src="/pub/image/facebook/snopes-bad.png" alt="You can't post this because it has a blocked link.

If you think you're seeing this by mistake, please let us know." height="226" width="478" />
</p><p>Then I thought I'd be clever, and I linked to the
<a href="http://coralcdn.org/">.nyud.net</a> version of the snopes page on the topic. I
earned the same message that my post included a blocked link.
</p><p>So then I tried again, with a link to a video on YouTube of the same
clip.
</p><p>That's when I first got the extremely generic message that "The message
could not be posted to this Wall." You can see the animation of what happened
next by hovering below.

</p><p>Finally, I removed all the links, and kept the first bit of text. For this,
I got the same generic error: "The message could not be posted to this Wall."
</p><p><b>Update</b>: Patrick points out I should link to the 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43z2NGHS2tI&t=32s">actual video</a>. Here it is, embedded:

</p><p>(BTW: The first thing I did was to click "let us know" to indicate that I think I'm seeing 
this by mistake. I filled out the form to indicate there was a problem in an honest, 
respectful way. I got back an email autoresponse that said, "Thanks for taking the time to

http://qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=593&forum=1</a> and on the OpenMoko device owners list).</p>

<p>
In order to make it easier to track updates to the Qtopia 4.3.1 
snapshots, I made a git repository out of them.
</p>

<p>
What I'm doing is, automatically (every night), untarring the snapshots
into a git repository at git://git.asheesh.org/qtopia_snapshot.git , which
is readable in a gitweb at <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=qtopia_snapshot.git">
http://git.asheesh.org/?p=qtopia_snapshot.git</a> .
</p>

<p>
Note that many snapshots contain the same contents; the automatic script
only commits if the snapshots contains some new data.
</p>

<p>
My current primary interest in the Qtopia GPL edition is for my HTC
Universal, which runs it very nicely including sleep and wake-up, SMS, and
voice calls. My interest in the git repositories lies from wanting to
publish a modified version of Qtopia that's easy to merge changes into as
Trolltech updates their code.  I'm sure there are Neo1973 users who would
like to hack on the Trolltech code or have an easy source repository from
which to get updates.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Qtopia">
http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Qtopia</a> is where I'll be posting any
is where I'll be posting any updates I have. If you're
working on a fork of Qtopia, I'd love to give out git commit access so you
can publish a branch on my git if you like.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if people want to publish their Qtopia-based applications 
in a git repository, just ask me!

<p>The Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation are two 
organizations that have put their mark of approval on Free/Libre Open 
Source Software licenses.  For those just joining us, those licenses are 
the permissions documents that make collaboration on software legal.  
The GNU General Public License and the "BSD License" (as if there's only 
one) are the two most famous ones.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about "the proliferation of Open Source licenses", and 
I also hear people claim their software is Open Source when there's no 
indication they're using a license that guarantees important freedoms to 
the software's users.  I don't think I ever hear people claim their 
software is Free Software when it's not - at least, not when they use 
capital letters.</p>

<p>I also hear from people that Open Source software and Free Software 
are different things.  My feelings on this are that people using the 
different terms are doing the same things, they just may be thinking 
different things when doing it.  Both groups have an interest in 
continuing to do what they're doing, even if they think of it 
differently.<p>

<p>(If you can find me an easy-ish to parse page listing the feelings of 
other organizations on the topic, like Debian, then I'll try to add them 
to this next time 'round.)</p>

<p>I wrote a program (<a 
href="http://svn.asheesh.org/svn/public/code/osi_vs_fsf/">source</a>) 
that scrapes the <a

Initiative's list of licenses</a> and <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html">the Free Software 
Foundation's list of licenses and comments about them</a> and generate a 
table showing you which licenses have been approved by which one.  I 
began coding in earnest on <a 
href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">Software Freedom Day</a>, and I'm

<p>A conversation between me and a wiser housemate, when I lived in
San Francicsco.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

Asheesh: "Hey, so I'm going to do some consulting work.
It's the first time I've done this as a professional,
like, not a student.
How much should I be charging per hour?"
</p>
<p>
Matt: "It's easy; do what I do. Think of the biggest amount you
can ask for with a straight face, then double it."
</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/osi-vs-fsf.html">prior post</a> with a big long table.  Here are some basic 
statistics from that table (as of Tuesday, September 25, 2007):</p>

<p>Summary: There are more "Free Software" licenses than "Open Source" 
licenses.</p>

<ul>

<li>Licenses approved by FSF alone: 51

</li><li>Licenses approved by OSI alone: 43

</li><li>Licenses approved by both: 16

</li></ul>

<p>Also, note that the program I whipped up for this is pretty terrible.  
Consider it the kind of software that academics would use but never 
publish for fear of embarrassment.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/mailman-website-header.html">Adding a Website: header to Mailman messages</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>Very often, I like to quote mailing list messages to people not on 
those mailing lists.  Mailman is a common mailing list program, and 
Pipermail is commonly used for storing archives.  What ends up happening 
is that I fish around for the archive link and spend a minute or two 
figuring out which message it is.</p>

<p>So I wrote a short program to do that scraping for me.  You can check 
it out (literally, if you want, with svn) at <a 
href="http://svn.asheesh.org/svn/public/code/mail_tools/">the mail_tools 
directory</a> - look for add_mailman_website_header.py and 
sample_message.</p>

<p>Why the "Website:" header?  Thunderbird seems to show that by 
default, so that's one less configuration option I have to change.  (To 
match this, I changed my alpine config to show it too.)</p>

<p>You may also want to look at the procmailrc snippets I use to insert 
it into the mail processing pipeline.  Embarrassingly, configuring 
procmail to set it up took as long as writing this thing; it's been way 
too long....</p>

<pre>
## &lt;Mailman header addition>
:0 W
MAILMAN_URL=| python ~/svn/public/code/mail_tools/add_mailman_website_header.py go

:0 Waf
| formail -b -A "Website: $MAILMAN_URL"

## &lt;/Mailman>
</pre>

<p>One more thing: If you run it with 0 arguments, it does a 
self-unittest (which in a few days will give false negatives; maybe 
that'll encourage me to improve the program, but probably not!).  Hence 
I give it the meaningless argument "go".  It also waits for a 
configurable (45s by default) amount of time for the pipermail index to 
get updated, as in real-world tests it beat the pipermail index for the 
two list messages.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Screenshot: Before</h3>

Here's some mail without the header:

<p><strong>Update 2007-10-24:</strong> It actually works now.  I worked 
around what appears to be a bug in the Python email module.  Report 
pending.  I'll post a screenshot in a day or two and call this project a 
success, except for all the other non-Mailman services to index.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/sysop/mail-tunnel.html">Sending mail from a laptop</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>I often find myself on what I would call "hostile" networks: They allow only very limited
Internet access, like by blocking port 25 so I can't connect to my mail server.  Maybe for you,
you're never on filtered Internet access, but your home ISP doesn't let you send mail out
when you're not <em>at</em> home, but you want to send email directly from your laptop anyway.
</p>

<p><strong>Just do what I do!</strong>  Let me explain.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li> inetd listens on port 125
</li><li> Connections to it go through an SSH tunnel that executes "nc localhost 25" on some mail server
</li><li> (Optional) A real MTA runs on the laptop, so that I can send mail when offline; when mail delivery fails temporarily, Postfix queues the message until I get back online.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Justification</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy</strong>. Apps can be configured to use localhost port 25 (or port 125) with no password.
</li><li><strong>Correct</strong>: Postfix (when using 25) handles sending mail when offline, and reattempts delivery for me.
</li><li><strong>Secure</strong>: Encryption all the way through the network, with the icing on the cake that this all looks like SSH, so nosy networkers near your laptop can't even see that's what you're doing.
</li></ul>

<h3>Implementation in Three Steps</h3>

<h4>Step 1: ssh tunnel</h4>

This is the hardest part.  To make things simple, I create a dedicated user on each end.

<h5>On the remote server (server)</h5>

<pre>
[me@laptop] $ ssh me@server
[me@server] $ sudo adduser tunnelendpoint
[me@server] $ sudo su - tunnelendpoint
[tunnelendpoint@server] $ mkdir .ssh
</pre>

<h5>On the local machine (laptop)</h5>

<pre>
[me@laptop] $ sudo adduser tunnelclient
[me@laptop] $ sudo su - tunnelclient
[tunnelclient@laptop] $ ssh-keygen -t rsa # make it passwordless
[tunnelclient@laptop] $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh tunnelendpoint@server 'mkdir -p .ssh ; chmod 0700 .ssh ; cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
</pre>

<h5>On the remote server</h5>

<pre>
[me@server] $ sudo su - tunnelendpoint
[tunnelendpoint@server] $ nano -w .ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

You'll see a key that starts with "ssh-dss".  Before that, add this string and leave a space before "ssh-dss":

<blockquote>
command="nc localhost 25",no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding 
</blockquote>

<p>(Note: "nc" is in the <strong>netcat</strong> package.)</p>

<h5>On the local machine (laptop)</h5>

<pre>
[tunnelclient@laptop] $ ssh tunnelendpoint@server
220 rose.makesad.us ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU): "<a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1186356">every tragedy is a beauty that has passed</a>"
</pre>

<p>Hooray!  If you see a reply like mine that starts with "220", then all is well.</p>

<p>You're done with the hard part.  Now the easy parts.</p>

<h4>Step 2: inetd</h4>

<pre>
[me@laptop] $ sudo aptitude install openbsd-inetd
</pre>

<p>Now edit /etc/inetd.conf to have this line:</p>

<pre>
127.0.0.1:125 stream  tcp     nowait  tunnelclient    /usr/bin/ssh    -q -T tunnelendpoint@server
</pre>

<p>Now restart the inetd (<strong>sudo /etc/init.d/openbsd-inetd restart</strong>) and test 
it:</p>

<pre>
[me@laptop] $ telnet localhost 125 
220 rose.makesad.us ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU): "<a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1186356">every tragedy is a beauty that has passed</a>"
</pre>

<h4>Step 3: Postfix (optional)</h4>

<p>This is my favorite part, but it's only necessary if you plan to send email when you're not 
connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>Just install Postfix, and add this to /etc/postfix/main.cf:</p>

<pre>relayhost = 127.0.0.1:125</pre>

<p>Restart Postfix and you should be set.  Try sending some mail!</p>

<h3>Closing</h3>

<p>I was inspired by a <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/487">Debian 
Administration</a> post, except I had my own ideas about the best way to do it.  I still like
my way best.</p>

<p>One problem with the above approach is that it requires root on "server".  It would be 
possible to do the ssh tunnel thing without using a separate "tunnelendpoint" account, but 
instead to add that key to your regular username.</p>

<p> I have a habit of entering a community and leaving both an announce 
and a discuss list wherever I go.  The wisdom of this is still 
unresolved.  I thought I'd share one thing I do beyond that: set the reply-to header on the announce list to go to the discuss list.</p>

<p>That way, when there's an announcement and the peanut gallery wants 
to add something, they'll reply and the people interested in hearing 
more will hear it.</p>

<p>I remembered this upon reading that the <a 
href="http://balug.org">BALUG</a> lists have the same sort of split, and 
that in particular that they were considering (on an opt-out basis) <a

       </h1>
		<p>
I <strong>love</strong> this song.  "I'm melting!" is the last song on 1999's <cite>Look Now Look Again</cite>.  
You can <a href="http://www.firelyrics.com/r/rainer_maria/im_melting.html">read the lyrics</a> or <a 
href="http://endof@paulproteus.acm.jhu.edu/rmad/09-I'm%20Melting!.mp3">download the song</a>.  Turn the volume up 
when you listen to it.
</p><p>
(Normally I'd link to the official lyrics, but for some reason they're <a 
href="http://rainermaria.com/discography/looknow.html">entirely missing</a>.)
</p><p>
Older Rainer Maria songs sometimes, as on "Rise" (the first track on this album), have the vocals cover the full 
range from "timid" to "soft".  Instead, this song starts with a bang and keeps it up; the drum hit before the 
guitar starts makes me think of someone taking a deep breath before loudly making known all the things she had 
been holding back from saying.  I can see her chatting politely with some boy who thinks some other girl is 
prettier (*) when her firey eyes open suddenly to let him know that she's been cheated out of a conversation 
anyone could care about.
</p><p>
In a show of personal strength rarely seen (and therefore deeply appreciated) in Rainer Maria, she sings verse 
and verse feeling dramatically more involved than this loser.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
I'm dying from only <br />
listening to you, <br />
and though I smile, <br />
it's just because I want to like you.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The feigned happiness of greeting was stretched so long she had to snap and write this song.
</p><p>
It's not just "more involved" that she feels; she's putting in effort in the conversation and getting nothing out 
of it.  These lyric captions don't capture the <em>force</em> in her voice.  Listen to "only, only" as she sings 
it.  Listen to how it parallels "over, over[whelming]" and "of, of [listening to you]".  After either stuttering 
or emphatically repeating these, she screams, "Though I'm quiet, I'll find my voice tonight."  Whether that means 
actually telling it to this guy or finding someone else she actually enjoys talking to we don't know.
</p><p>
The activity (would you describe it as scattered, and then collected, in two or three measure blocks?) on the 
guitar and drums throughout the first part of the song is tremendously energizing.  You hear an echo of the style 
in the "Take me out... I'll melt" section, but it's almost as if the energy from the vitriol of the first half 
has healed; she has changed her message from screaming in pent-up agony-turned-rage to a self-assured "Yes, I'm 
like this."
</p><p>
I love the song's structure.  The similarity between "overwhelming you with lies" and "only listening to you" is 
hammered home in the stylistic similarities I mentioned earlier.  It's easy to lose the words in the music and 
the rhythm of her vowel repetition.  (It actually took me quite a few years to get the lyrics down in the right 
order.)
</p><p>
"I can be so cold sometimes" leads to a great crescendo which quiets down to a whisper from the guitar.  It 
grows, and grows, and she declares, "Take me out, and I'll melt."
</p><p>
What does it mean to melt here?  The sentence is almost a threat; "take me out" to meet people and I'll put up a 
facade of trying to like them until I lash out at them?  For me, the song can be a reminder of how, despite any 
naysayers, you really are as exciting a person as you once felt.  You don't need any justification, and if 
they're not appreciating you, you can just drop them.  It does serve as a terrible song to think about when 
meeting people at a party, however.
</p><p>
Even as the song ends on this more mellow note, which I summarized above as, "Yes, I'm like this," the guitar is 
unfailing in maintaining its pitch and fervor as it ends the album.  By no means is such self-empowering energy 
indicative of the album; as one of Rainer Maria's best albums, it covers a mix of deeply recognizable feelings.  
With the ability to look back over their career since then, the solo female voice on this song foreshadows songs 
like "Ears Ring" from 2003 and most of their new album, <cite>Catastrophe Keeps Us Together</cite>.  Contrast 
that to Kyle's contributions to the track before it, "Centrifuge."  Also, contrast this last song on an album to 
"Hell and High Water" on 2001's <cite>A Better Version of Me</cite>.
</p><p>
Other favorite songs of mine by Rainer Maria leave me introspective or pensive.  Many Rainer Maria lines I love 
depict the singer holding the broken pieces of something she loves in her hands and wonder if it can be put back 
together.  Not this one; this is a trip of well-justified self-importance.  I really hope they play it on Sunday!  
(And I hope they feel energetic and happy enough to pull off playing it.)
</p><p>
(P.S. Yes, I know, this post is a little late.  Sorry about that.)

information as possible and be able to be as free as possible to act on 
that information.  I use "information" broadly to include, for example, 
the current weather, the math necessary to predict future weather, and 
computer software that does such calculations.  I once thought that this 
"information" should include information about people, but now I'm more 
confused about that.<p>

<p>Lately I've had to pay bills, so I did what I always do when I have a
