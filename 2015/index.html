        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/this-site.html">How this website gets published
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>In case you're interested, here are the technical details on how this website gets published.
</p>
<ul><li> On my laptop, there's a directory, ~/projects/asheesh.org.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It contains a <tt>git clone</tt> of a private git repository. That private git repository is hosted on my personal server, <tt>rose.makesad.us</tt>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> I run a git hosting app called Gogs, using a web app package manager called Sandstorm, on my server which runs Debian GNU/Linux.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Inside ~/projects/asheesh.org there is a directory called <tt>entries</tt>. Inside that, you'll find <tt>entries/note</tt>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> I create a file called <tt>entries/note/software/this-site.mw</tt> which contains the content of this blog post, in MediaWiki markup format, because when I first put this publishing system   together, I was hopeful that MediaWiki markup format would win against Markdown. (I lost that battle.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> I commit that file to git.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> I run <tt>make update-snapshot</tt> on my laptop, which uses Pyblosxom (a 2004-era static site publishing system that I'm happy to say is still being maintained) to convert the various Markdown files and template files into HTML. Pyblosxom uses the file's mtime on disk to generate the datestamp that you see, so I use a tool called <tt>git-set-mtime</tt> to automatically use the last git commit time as the file's mtime on disk.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> I run <tt>make deploy</tt> which uses the <tt>owncloudcmd</tt> program to push the static site content to a directory on rose.makesad.us. Specifically, it synchronizes to an instance of another app in my Sandstorm setup called Davros.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Davros is shockingly convenient, because it contains the ability to receive files via <tt>owncloudcmd</tt> _and_ it has the ability to serve them out to the world. For this, it relies on the help of Sandstorm and Sandstorm's static publishing API.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> So when a request comes in, it hits <tt>nginx</tt> running in the Debian-ish world on my server, and nginx knows that for the asheesh.org host, to send the request to the Sandstorm service running on <tt>localhost:6080</tt>. Sandstorm then looks at the inbound request, notices it's for asheesh.org, and does a DNS lookup check to find out which _grain_ (the Sandstorm term for app instance) is responsible for serving static content for asheesh.org, finds the Davros grain, and then serves the HTML that Davros registerd with Sandstorm via the static publishing API.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Savvy systems-minded people will appreciate that the Davros code isn't on the critical path for serving a web page.
</li></ul>
<p>That's a large collection of things, but I like how they fit together. And, moreover, the fact that
you can see this content means that the whole pipeline is working!

       </h1>
		<p>How to think about marketing, when marketing to developers
</p><p>Video link:
</p>
<ul><li> http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2013-10-22-danielle-morrill
</li></ul>
<p>Interesting phrases:
</p>
<ul><li> Sales is getting rejected one by one. Marketing is "getting rejected at scale."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Much of the time, "You're trying to write to about 200 people" (at a time).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Every single one of those tweets [referencing other people's content] is a missed opportunity to link to your own content."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "You'll never be able to think like a noob again" -- "your content will basically suffer from the curse of knowledge."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Your blog is, like, the cheapest banner ad in the world."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "It has to be OK to ship something crappy, incrementally improve it, and then never ever ever stop doing it." 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "People _love_ the process of how the sausage is getting made." My remark -- the great thing is you can show them just the parts you want to.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Anything you do is news in your community. It doesn't matter that it's not news in the rest of the world."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Troll slayers have to be above reproach."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The good thing is, when you make people angry, it means they're thinking about you."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The value of different channels is you need multiple opportunities to connect with the same people."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Write Google Voice in 50 lines of code." The idea here is, say clearly how people can use your tools as technical leverage. People aren't as good as you at connecting the dots of why your thing is so cool.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Sometimes it's good to just power the toys, and let the hobbyists decide what's exciting to them."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "You want to get your community helping each other."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "In the early days, you want to talk to everyone."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The company voice becomes an amalgamation of personal voices," except when something bad happens (unless the CEO is visible and willing to communicate).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "To write good content, you need to read a lot."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> On topics that you can get other people to write: "You have to convince them they picked [the topic] for themselves, or you have to let them pick them."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Read the people your community trusts and respects."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Surround people, so they can find you in the channels they like."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Go do all the things people would do to try to find you."
</li></ul>
<p>Types of content:
</p>
<ul><li> Email newsletter
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Email drip campaign; these two are enough for the first year. Care about open rates.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Ranked #3: Make a blog. Possible content: (1) anything at all. (2) Contests. (3) Write glorious beautiful documentation as blog posts.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "How it works" diagram.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Write about customers. "Didn't you actually change the world?"
</li></ul>
<p>Interesting things they found:
</p>
<ul><li> "Trailing open rates of months on the first email" -- that is to say, the first email newsletter was pure gold, so people kept re-opening it.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Developer Marketing is a thing Microsofties figured out in the '90s; google for it.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Get good at comments, because you're gonna have to fix things."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Good self-introduction posts answer the question, "What are you bringing to the table?" (The audience should care that you're part of $COMPANY.) How can your presence in the company make customers more successful?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If you want every engineer to be able to present what the product is, then ask everyone to build something using the product plus present it to the company, and now they won't be afraid of presenting things to other people.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Have developers write the documentation themselves."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Write short blog posts.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The content that makes the most money is case studies."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The best piece of content is something that makes people think of your company more highly than before."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The under-appreciated thing where you can be best at it is the content that rocks."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> (No video. Too much work.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Tweet the same thing -- once at 10am, once at 4pm. . . . No one is looking at stuff at the same time."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "You know better than anyone the businesses that can be built on your platform, so write the recipes for them."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> For emails: "Automatically opt people in, then make sure to build good segemented lists. Keep your lists for your campaigns separate from your newsletter."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "If the production quality of the email is high, people will assume it's high quality."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "Make sure you have a clear conversation internally about what you do and don't want to share."
</li></ul>
<p>Interesting questions:
</p>
<ul><li> On Sandstorm, how many people use which pages? Blog vs. app vs. app store list.
</li></ul>
<p>Things I need to revisit:
</p>
<ul><li> Repurposing content.
</li></ul>
<p>More content ideas:
</p>
<ul><li> Publish internal emails.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Blog your FAQ. (Also make sure the content appears everywhere else it needs to -- Stack Overflow, etc.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Any time we go and give a talk.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Take photos at Meetups.
</li></ul>
<p>Questions for me:
</p>
<ul><li> Perhaps Sandstorm should use Stack Overflow as our main Q&A plan.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Perhaps I should publish my first all at corp.sandstorm.io mail?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Does Sandstorm have enough blog posts by non-Kenton people? ("No one sells it like a first ten engineering team.")
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Are we set up for our website to communicate effectively? Does the product communicate effectively?
</li></ul>
<p>What to measure, early on:
</p>
<ul><li> Look at web traffic.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> How many times you got mentioned on Twitter.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Whether or not people comment at all (on external discussion areas like Hacker News).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Broadly the levels of how many people hang out in your IRC room. "Just monitor the level of people helping each other."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> In the first six months, don't focus on revenue, because the opportunity is all the customers you haven't reached yet.
</li></ul>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/scribble/meteor-community-thoughts.html">Quick thoughts about Jade's Meteor community talk
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>URL:
</p>
<ul><li> http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2014-07-08-jade-wang
</li></ul>
<p>Very interesting phrases:
</p>
<ul><li> "they are in charge"
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "power law"
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "invest in leadership, not participation"
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "don't be afraid to give people real power"
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "what if you look for community organizers in your community?"
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "poured fuel on the fire"
</li></ul>
<p>Very interesting concepts:
</p>
<ul><li> Devshop London.
</li></ul>
<p>Remaining questions for Jade:
</p>
<ul><li> What were some of the Devshop failure modes that were continually tweaked? How will they get tweaked in London?
</li></ul>
<p>Questions/thoughts it brings up for me:
</p>
<ul><li> Meteor & co. have a "Chapters" list. I'm borderline surprised that they are using mailing lists. Moreover, how do they get activity on the list? (Do they?)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Who are the leaders we could massively empower for OSCTC? Probably Davis.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Does this mean we should rethink the idea of Chapters?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> For Railsbridge, where are their leaders that they empower? Luckily the chapters process structurally encourages local leadership. I've seen it at least in Boston.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> What would we say for BPW? Chicago? Almost. Philly? Probably/possibly.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Was the real failure of BPW that we didn't try to identify local leaders for regional chapters? If so, how did I miss that?
<ul><li> I guess we tried to, but we didn't structurally encourage it. Amazing.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> What do we say about Debian, then?
<ul><li> 1K developers, but leaders? Maybe not as much. Which results in less growth in terms of user base. Breath-taking.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> For Ubuntu+Debian, and presumably meteor, The leadership needed is not so much technical as community/marketing. Jade tries not to call it marketing, but I don't know if she realizes how it's not technical leadership she's after.
<ul><li> Debian always wanted technical leaders to show up, and the package maintainer based process encourages that structurally. But it does nothing structurally to encourage community/marketing leadership.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Other remarks:
</p>
<ul><li> Jade looks back and forth at the computer a lot. Maybe not given a lot of talks yet?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Very few "um"s, but some.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Infrequent smiles at the audience -- interesting.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> A great talk, regardless of some trivial style quibbles.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> 62 meetup groups, 1-5 captains apiece.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> First meetup, reimburse for food and snacks. Generally cover the Meetup.com dues.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Initially, found people doing interesting things with Meteor -- publicized their work, but also got in touch.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The day of the monthly Meteor DevShops, they invite people to show up IRL, which fosters peer to peer communication. 
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Overall remarks:
</p><p>It's not every day I watch a talk from someone who works in my space 
who has an idea that makes me rethink a lot of what I've done.
</p><p>Welcome to Sandstorm.
