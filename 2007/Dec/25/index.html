<p>
At the start of the summer, I read an article by a journalist who 
successfully worked for his U.S.-based company while wandering South 
America for a month.  No one knew that when he interviewed them over 
Skype, he said, he was thousands of miles away.
<p>

<p>That sounded pretty good, so I wanted to try it.  I was invited to 
speak on behalf of Science Commons, and Herbert had been to Japan but I 
hadn't, so I thought that this trip to Tokyo would be a good one to 
start with.  Some basic notes (more later, hopefully):</p>

<ul>
<li>Weekends are really useful.  If you're working in the daytime, 
you'll miss out on lots of great things that can only happen in the 
afternoon.</li>
<li>You'll miss people from home.  Some of them might miss you too, but 
you'll have less way of knowing that.</li>
<li>Plans are useful.  Guide books that have walking tours with lists of 
places to go, marked on the map of the walking tours, are immensely 
helpful.</li>
<li>Seeing people takes time.  If you're lucky (or if you're smart), you 
can arrange to see people in places you actually wanted to go in the 
first place.  Maybe you can do what I'm doing today, which is 
(hopefully) seeing an act of a Kabuki play somewhere before 
meeting up with people, or maybe you can manage to chat with 
people as you walk through some nice park.  Otherwise, be 
aware that 
you're adding to the places you 
have to go see.
</li>
<li>Speaking French is fun, and it's one of the few activities 
where if people compliment you don't have to feel bad
accepting the compliment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just before and after committing to my plane tickets, as I remarked 
that I was leaving Tokyo on a Saturday, I wondered, Maybe I should 
extend this so I have the weekend in Tokyo.  The big lesson from this 
trip is, Yes, you need weekends.  You weren't really able to use 
the weekend of the conference, and you could have predicted as much way 
earlier.
