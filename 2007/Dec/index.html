       </h1>
		
<p>
At the start of the summer, I read an article by a journalist who 
successfully worked for his U.S.-based company while wandering South 
America for a month.  No one knew that when he interviewed them over 
Skype, he said, he was thousands of miles away.
<p>

<p>That sounded pretty good, so I wanted to try it.  I was invited to 
speak on behalf of Science Commons, and Herbert had been to Japan but I 
hadn't, so I thought that this trip to Tokyo would be a good one to 
start with.  Some basic notes (more later, hopefully):</p>

<ul>
<li>Weekends are really useful.  If you're working in the daytime, 
you'll miss out on lots of great things that can only happen in the 
afternoon.</li>
<li>You'll miss people from home.  Some of them might miss you too, but 
you'll have less way of knowing that.</li>
<li>Plans are useful.  Guide books that have walking tours with lists of 
places to go, marked on the map of the walking tours, are immensely 
helpful.</li>
<li>Seeing people takes time.  If you're lucky (or if you're smart), you 
can arrange to see people in places you actually wanted to go in the 
first place.  Maybe you can do what I'm doing today, which is 
(hopefully) seeing an act of a Kabuki play somewhere before 
meeting up with people, or maybe you can manage to chat with 
people as you walk through some nice park.  Otherwise, be 
aware that 
you're adding to the places you 
have to go see.
</li>
<li>Speaking French is fun, and it's one of the few activities 
where if people compliment you don't have to feel bad
accepting the compliment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just before and after committing to my plane tickets, as I remarked 
that I was leaving Tokyo on a Saturday, I wondered, Maybe I should 
extend this so I have the weekend in Tokyo.  The big lesson from this 
trip is, Yes, you need weekends.  You weren't really able to use 
the weekend of the conference, and you could have predicted as much way 
earlier.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/trolltech-git.html">Git repository for Qtopia</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>(Cross-posted at
<a href="http://qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=593&forum=1">
http://qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=593&forum=1</a> and on the OpenMoko device owners list).</p>

<p>
In order to make it easier to track updates to the Qtopia 4.3.1 
snapshots, I made a git repository out of them.
</p>

<p>
What I'm doing is, automatically (every night), untarring the snapshots
into a git repository at git://git.asheesh.org/qtopia_snapshot.git , which
is readable in a gitweb at <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=qtopia_snapshot.git">
http://git.asheesh.org/?p=qtopia_snapshot.git</a> .
</p>

<p>
Note that many snapshots contain the same contents; the automatic script
only commits if the snapshots contains some new data.
</p>

<p>
My current primary interest in the Qtopia GPL edition is for my HTC
Universal, which runs it very nicely including sleep and wake-up, SMS, and
voice calls. My interest in the git repositories lies from wanting to
publish a modified version of Qtopia that's easy to merge changes into as
Trolltech updates their code.  I'm sure there are Neo1973 users who would
like to hack on the Trolltech code or have an easy source repository from
which to get updates.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Qtopia">
http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Qtopia</a> is where I'll be posting any
is where I'll be posting any updates I have. If you're
working on a fork of Qtopia, I'd love to give out git commit access so you
can publish a branch on my git if you like.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if people want to publish their Qtopia-based applications 
in a git repository, just ask me!

&lt;paulproteus> Er, that was meant for someone else.

&lt;paulproteus> I mean, you're welcome to read it, too.
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> It's actually interesting if you ask me why. (-;
<br />
&lt;lisaig_> Why?
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> Kevin Rose (supposedely) from TechTV (a then-famous, well, tech TV show) is looking for a co-founder of the Linux On Unmodified Xbox project, "lou-x".
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> That co-founder (supposedly; it's hard to figure who's actually who, but this one's credible) replies, "We got smoked by the Xbox-Linux project."
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> I came into the LOU-X project in late 2002 and donated bandwidth from JHU and a wiki I ran, and by mid 2003 preferring to help Xbox-Linux.
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> Actually, maybe my stint with LOU-X lasted only a month or two.

       </h1>
		
<p>I'm starting a new project called "fetchvoicemail".  The idea is to 
have a little app that dials my voice mail, saves the messages, and 
extracts the metadata from the remote bot, and saves it all to local 
storage.  That way I can write whatever UI I want on top of it.  Think 
of it as POP3 for voicemail.</p>

<p>It seems there is already a commercial service that does this called 
"GotVoice Premium" that was <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,139412/article.html">reviewed by PC World</a>.</p>

<p>So far, I'm in experiment and read mode.  All I've yet discovered is 
that if you mess with ALSA settings, you make something strange happen 
so that your microphone doesn't actually record anything....</p>

<p>In Python, if you use smart libraries like SQLObject, SQLAlchemy, and 
Kid, you can't generate invalid SQL or HTML, so you're not vulnerable to 
SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other attacks derived from 
input validation problems.</p>

<p>Unless you're really smart:</p>

abstracted version of SQL injection attacks.

<p>Just a reminder that attacks against syntax aren't all you need to stop; attacks against semantics can be bad, too.</p>
