guilty</a> to being malicious:</p>

<blockquote>
John Kenneth Schiefer, 26, variously known online as "acid" and 
"acidstorm," agreed to plead guilty to at least four felony charges of 
fraud and wiretapping, charges punishable by $1.75 million in fines and 
nearly 60 years in prison.
</blockquote>

<p>That was for for 250,000 computers.  When the evidence is laid out 
against people at AT&T, if the evidence says they defrauded and 
wiretapped at least 100 times that many people, what will their 
punishment be?</p>

<p>I'm rooting for 60 * 100 years in jail, spread evenly among the 
people who did the wiretapping.  Or perhaps 60 * 100 years for each 
person, if that seems more fair.</p>

<p>When I explain to people what the MIT Mystery Hunt is, I usually give 
this example from 2004:</p>

<p>You are faced with a web page whose title is "Track 13" and that 
embeds an MP3 file.  The file is aobut 30 seconds long, and it seems to 
be two-second snippets from about 15 songs.  So you get a bunch of 
people together, and you identify the songs.  Once you write out the 
track titles, they look something like this:</p>

<pre>
<b>O</b>rder by New Era
<b>R</b>apid Fire by The Pixies
<b>D</b>elirium of Disorder by Bad Religion
<b>E</b>ggcellent Epiphanies by The Choo-Choo Train
<b>R</b>aindrops Fallin' On My Head by Ozzy Osbourne

</pre>

<p>That is, the first column spells out "ORDER LYRIC CLIPS BY RANK".  So 
now you have to figure out the lyric clips that you've been hearing, 
which takes even more collaboration and Googling, and once you do, you 
stare at it, trying to figure out an order until someone comes by and 
says, "Hey, <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> just released their top songs 
list this year."  So you order it by that and you get the name of some 
band, followed by "NOT DON".</p>

<p>As luck has it, everyone in that band (according to All Music Guide) 
had the letters "DON" in their name, except for one guy.  So you call in 
his last name as the answer, and you move on.  We did all this in the 
Bio Lab of ESG.</p>

<p>In the 2007 hunt, we had a new music puzzle!  We began to work on it 
in the Bio Lab of ESG!  But when I asked if anyone remembered "Track 13" 
or worked on it, they all had blank faces.</p>

<p>Maybe the explanation is not that I'm old.  After all, there are 
veterans on the team who have been there since I joined them.  But it 
struck me as evidence of a generation boundary, which saddened me, 
especially in my last year at Hopkins where most of my good 
friends had already graduated.</p>

<p>John Wilbanks from <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science 
Commons</a> asked me to give a talk about the Neurocommons project on 
SC's behalf in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Monday evening, as I was sitting in the CC office wondering what to 
work on next, I decided I would put all my papers in order and update my 
calendar so I would have precise notes about which of the many email 
attachment I'd need to refer to at which time.   I wasn't leaving until 
Wednesday, but I figured I'd need to do this sometime.</p>

<p>That's when I learned that I was actually leaving 
<strong>Tuesday</strong>, not Wednesday.  The only reason I made my 
flight is because I procrastinated real work with organizational work.  
The shock from that realization lasted for pretty much the twelve hours 
that followed it.</p>

<p>But right now, I'm in an airplane that will soon land in Tokyo.  I'll 
be <a 
href="http://kashiwaio.dir.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/workshop03.html">presenting</a> 
on Thursday, and attending the rest of the conference Friday and 
Saturday, and then I plan to sort of hang out in Japan for a week 
(ingeniously, I'll work remotely, so I can hang out in Japan without 
using precious vacation time).  So if you want to hang out, or if you 
want to tell me what to do / where to eat / who to meet, drop me a <a 
href="mailto:japan@asheesh.org">line</a>!</p>

<p>I'll probably get a cell phone for the time that I'm here (apparently 
the Japanese aren't really into GSM, so I'll have to rent a real local 
one), and presumably I'll post its number when I have it.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where I'll sleep and bathe after the conference, 
it's in <a 
href="http://joilab.ito.com/2007/10/what-is-joi-itos-lab.html">Joi's 
Lab</a>!</p>

<p>AT&T has been "allegedly" <a 
href="http://www.eff.org/cases/att">illegally wiretapping Americans for 
ages and giving that data illegally to the government</a>.  Here's the 
government's take:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/washington/23nsa.html?hp">
The companies face suits from customers who say their privacy was 
violated. Administration officials say they worry that the suits, 
pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 
could bankrupt the utilities.
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't "worry" they could bankrupt the utilities.  I 
<strong>hope</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is no incentive for these corporations, and others in a long 
line past them, to follow the law, then we no longer have the rule of 
law: companies will simply do illegal things and then explain that if 
the law were enforced, they'd have to pay some money.</p>

<p>I've been screaming and swearing about this for a week.  I can't 
understand how anyone can calmly disagree with this.</p>

<p>Let me remind you that the President, who is charge of the executive 
branch of government in this country, "shall take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed" according to the <a 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html#section2">Constitution</a>.</p>
