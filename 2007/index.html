       </h1>
		
<p>
At the start of the summer, I read an article by a journalist who 
successfully worked for his U.S.-based company while wandering South 
America for a month.  No one knew that when he interviewed them over 
Skype, he said, he was thousands of miles away.
<p>

<p>That sounded pretty good, so I wanted to try it.  I was invited to 
speak on behalf of Science Commons, and Herbert had been to Japan but I 
hadn't, so I thought that this trip to Tokyo would be a good one to 
start with.  Some basic notes (more later, hopefully):</p>

<ul>
<li>Weekends are really useful.  If you're working in the daytime, 
you'll miss out on lots of great things that can only happen in the 
afternoon.</li>
<li>You'll miss people from home.  Some of them might miss you too, but 
you'll have less way of knowing that.</li>
<li>Plans are useful.  Guide books that have walking tours with lists of 
places to go, marked on the map of the walking tours, are immensely 
helpful.</li>
<li>Seeing people takes time.  If you're lucky (or if you're smart), you 
can arrange to see people in places you actually wanted to go in the 
first place.  Maybe you can do what I'm doing today, which is 
(hopefully) seeing an act of a Kabuki play somewhere before 
meeting up with people, or maybe you can manage to chat with 
people as you walk through some nice park.  Otherwise, be 
aware that 
you're adding to the places you 
have to go see.
</li>
<li>Speaking French is fun, and it's one of the few activities 
where if people compliment you don't have to feel bad
accepting the compliment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just before and after committing to my plane tickets, as I remarked 
that I was leaving Tokyo on a Saturday, I wondered, Maybe I should 
extend this so I have the weekend in Tokyo.  The big lesson from this 
trip is, Yes, you need weekends.  You weren't really able to use 
the weekend of the conference, and you could have predicted as much way 
earlier.

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/software/trolltech-git.html">Git repository for Qtopia</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>(Cross-posted at
<a href="http://qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=593&forum=1">
http://qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=593&forum=1</a> and on the OpenMoko device owners list).</p>

<p>
In order to make it easier to track updates to the Qtopia 4.3.1 
snapshots, I made a git repository out of them.
</p>

<p>
What I'm doing is, automatically (every night), untarring the snapshots
into a git repository at git://git.asheesh.org/qtopia_snapshot.git , which
is readable in a gitweb at <a href="http://git.asheesh.org/?p=qtopia_snapshot.git">
http://git.asheesh.org/?p=qtopia_snapshot.git</a> .
</p>

<p>
Note that many snapshots contain the same contents; the automatic script
only commits if the snapshots contains some new data.
</p>

<p>
My current primary interest in the Qtopia GPL edition is for my HTC
Universal, which runs it very nicely including sleep and wake-up, SMS, and
voice calls. My interest in the git repositories lies from wanting to
publish a modified version of Qtopia that's easy to merge changes into as
Trolltech updates their code.  I'm sure there are Neo1973 users who would
like to hack on the Trolltech code or have an easy source repository from
which to get updates.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Qtopia">
http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Qtopia</a> is where I'll be posting any
is where I'll be posting any updates I have. If you're
working on a fork of Qtopia, I'd love to give out git commit access so you
can publish a branch on my git if you like.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if people want to publish their Qtopia-based applications 
in a git repository, just ask me!

&lt;lisaig_> Why?
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> Kevin Rose (supposedely) from TechTV (a then-famous, well, tech TV show) is looking for a co-founder of the Linux On Unmodified Xbox project, "lou-x".
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> That co-founder (supposedly; it's hard to figure who's actually who, but this one's credible) replies, "We got smoked by the Xbox-Linux project."
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> I came into the LOU-X project in late 2002 and donated bandwidth from JHU and a wiki I ran, and by mid 2003 preferring to help Xbox-Linux.
<br />
&lt;paulproteus> Actually, maybe my stint with LOU-X lasted only a month or two.

<p>I'm starting a new project called "fetchvoicemail".  The idea is to 
have a little app that dials my voice mail, saves the messages, and 
extracts the metadata from the remote bot, and saves it all to local 
storage.  That way I can write whatever UI I want on top of it.  Think 
of it as POP3 for voicemail.</p>

<p>It seems there is already a commercial service that does this called 
"GotVoice Premium" that was <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,139412/article.html">reviewed by PC World</a>.</p>

<p>So far, I'm in experiment and read mode.  All I've yet discovered is 
that if you mess with ALSA settings, you make something strange happen 
so that your microphone doesn't actually record anything....</p>

John Kenneth Schiefer, 26, variously known online as "acid" and

nearly 60 years in prison.

<p>That was for for 250,000 computers.  When the evidence is laid out 
against people at AT&T, if the evidence says they defrauded and 
wiretapped at least 100 times that many people, what will their 
punishment be?</p>

<p>I'm rooting for 60 * 100 years in jail, spread evenly among the 
people who did the wiretapping.  Or perhaps 60 * 100 years for each 
person, if that seems more fair.</p>

<p>John Wilbanks from <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science 
Commons</a> asked me to give a talk about the Neurocommons project on 
SC's behalf in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Monday evening, as I was sitting in the CC office wondering what to 
work on next, I decided I would put all my papers in order and update my 
calendar so I would have precise notes about which of the many email 
attachment I'd need to refer to at which time.   I wasn't leaving until 
Wednesday, but I figured I'd need to do this sometime.</p>

<p>That's when I learned that I was actually leaving 
<strong>Tuesday</strong>, not Wednesday.  The only reason I made my 
flight is because I procrastinated real work with organizational work.  
The shock from that realization lasted for pretty much the twelve hours 
that followed it.</p>

<p>But right now, I'm in an airplane that will soon land in Tokyo.  I'll 
be <a 
href="http://kashiwaio.dir.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/workshop03.html">presenting</a> 
on Thursday, and attending the rest of the conference Friday and 
Saturday, and then I plan to sort of hang out in Japan for a week 
(ingeniously, I'll work remotely, so I can hang out in Japan without 
using precious vacation time).  So if you want to hang out, or if you 
want to tell me what to do / where to eat / who to meet, drop me a <a 
href="mailto:japan@asheesh.org">line</a>!</p>

<p>I'll probably get a cell phone for the time that I'm here (apparently 
the Japanese aren't really into GSM, so I'll have to rent a real local 
one), and presumably I'll post its number when I have it.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where I'll sleep and bathe after the conference, 
it's in <a 
href="http://joilab.ito.com/2007/10/what-is-joi-itos-lab.html">Joi's 
Lab</a>!</p>

<p>When I explain to people what the MIT Mystery Hunt is, I usually give 
this example from 2004:</p>

<p>You are faced with a web page whose title is "Track 13" and that 
embeds an MP3 file.  The file is aobut 30 seconds long, and it seems to 
be two-second snippets from about 15 songs.  So you get a bunch of 
people together, and you identify the songs.  Once you write out the 
track titles, they look something like this:</p>

<pre>

<b>R</b>apid Fire by The Pixies
<b>D</b>elirium of Disorder by Bad Religion

<b>N</b>athan's Rise by Mozart
<b>K</b>atholic Kookies by Kristian At Heart
</pre>

<p>That is, the first column spells out "ORDER LYRIC CLIPS BY RANK".  So 
now you have to figure out the lyric clips that you've been hearing, 
which takes even more collaboration and Googling, and once you do, you 
stare at it, trying to figure out an order until someone comes by and 
says, "Hey, <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> just released their top songs 
list this year."  So you order it by that and you get the name of some 
band, followed by "NOT DON".</p>

<p>As luck has it, everyone in that band (according to All Music Guide) 
had the letters "DON" in their name, except for one guy.  So you call in 
his last name as the answer, and you move on.  We did all this in the 
Bio Lab of ESG.</p>

<p>In the 2007 hunt, we had a new music puzzle!  We began to work on it 
in the Bio Lab of ESG!  But when I asked if anyone remembered "Track 13" 
or worked on it, they all had blank faces.</p>

<p>Maybe the explanation is not that I'm old.  After all, there are 
veterans on the team who have been there since I joined them.  But it 
struck me as evidence of a generation boundary, which saddened me, 
especially in my last year at Hopkins where most of my good 
friends had already graduated.</p>

<p>AT&T has been "allegedly" <a 
href="http://www.eff.org/cases/att">illegally wiretapping Americans for 
ages and giving that data illegally to the government</a>.  Here's the 
government's take:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/washington/23nsa.html?hp">
The companies face suits from customers who say their privacy was 
violated. Administration officials say they worry that the suits, 
pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 
could bankrupt the utilities.
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't "worry" they could bankrupt the utilities.  I 
<strong>hope</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is no incentive for these corporations, and others in a long 
line past them, to follow the law, then we no longer have the rule of 
law: companies will simply do illegal things and then explain that if 
the law were enforced, they'd have to pay some money.</p>

<p>I've been screaming and swearing about this for a week.  I can't 
understand how anyone can calmly disagree with this.</p>

<p>Let me remind you that the President, who is charge of the executive 
branch of government in this country, "shall take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed" according to the <a 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html#section2">Constitution</a>.</p>

statistics from that table (as of Tuesday, September 25, 2007):</p>

<p>Summary: There are more "Free Software" licenses than "Open Source" 
licenses.</p>

<ul>

<li>Licenses approved by FSF alone: 51

</li><li>Licenses approved by OSI alone: 43

</li><li>Licenses approved by both: 16

</li></ul>

<p>Also, note that the program I whipped up for this is pretty terrible.  
Consider it the kind of software that academics would use but never 
publish for fear of embarrassment.</p>

<p>The Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation are two 
organizations that have put their mark of approval on Free/Libre Open 
Source Software licenses.  For those just joining us, those licenses are 
the permissions documents that make collaboration on software legal.  
The GNU General Public License and the "BSD License" (as if there's only 
one) are the two most famous ones.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about "the proliferation of Open Source licenses", and 
I also hear people claim their software is Open Source when there's no 
indication they're using a license that guarantees important freedoms to 
the software's users.  I don't think I ever hear people claim their 
software is Free Software when it's not - at least, not when they use 
capital letters.</p>

<p>I also hear from people that Open Source software and Free Software 
are different things.  My feelings on this are that people using the 
different terms are doing the same things, they just may be thinking 
different things when doing it.  Both groups have an interest in 
continuing to do what they're doing, even if they think of it 
differently.<p>

<p>(If you can find me an easy-ish to parse page listing the feelings of 
other organizations on the topic, like Debian, then I'll try to add them 
to this next time 'round.)</p>

<p>I wrote a program (<a 
href="http://svn.asheesh.org/svn/public/code/osi_vs_fsf/">source</a>) 
that scrapes the <a 
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">Open Source 
Initiative's list of licenses</a> and <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html">the Free Software 
Foundation's list of licenses and comments about them</a> and generate a 
table showing you which licenses have been approved by which one.  I 
began coding in earnest on <a 
href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">Software Freedom Day</a>, and I'm 
publishing it and its results in belated celebration of that day.  So 
here you all go:</p>

       <h1 id="cross-browser" style="border-top: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/laptop/fast-seek-slash.html">Fast seek slash</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>My laptop feels slow.  Having run no metrics, I'm going to guess a 
lot of the reason that apt-get takes more than a second or two to load 
its database is the seek time of the hard drive.  It's some boring 5400 
RPM sucker, and it has moving parts which have to move.  Totally 
lame.</p>

<p>So I'll replace it with flash of some kind.  Flash is expensive for 
lots of space, so it's probably wasteful of dollars to make it my /home 
partition.  But if / were fast, then at least apt and application 
launching would be faster.  And swap would be faster in a world where 
seeks are almost free, too.</p>

<h3>Solid State Disk, or CF card</h3>

<p>Here are the contenders in pre-packaged solid state land:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.transcendusa.com/Products/ModDetail.asp?ModNo=164">
Transcend's solid-state hard drives</a>. Unfortunately no one on 
products.google.com seems to have these in stock.
</li><li>

<a 
href="http://www.sandisk.com/OEM/ProductCatalog(1274)-SanDisk_SSD_Solid_State_Drives.aspx">
SanDisk SSD (formerly FFD) UATA 2.5”</a>.  Apparently these are an OEM-only part.
</li></ul>

<p>So it's off to CompactFlash cards then.  Cards compatible with the 
CompactFlash 4.0 spec can do Ultra DMA mode 4, which I don't even 
remember how many megabytes a second but it should be fast.  The cards 
themselves should be fast, too; no point putting a slow card on a fast 
bus.  It looks like Transcend's 8GB TS8GCF266 is the best in 
price-performance, around $140.</p>

<h3>What about the flash media dying tragically and abruptly?</h3>

<p>It's true, flash media have a maximum number of writes they can take 
before tragedy.  Hopefully things will be fine; <a 
href="http://www.transcendusa.com/Products/ModDetail.asp?ModNo=148&SpNo=3&LangNo=0">Transcend's 
specifications</a> seem to say has "1 000 000 times" endurance, which 
presumably means writes.  And consumer-grade Flash cards do <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_levelling">wear leveling</a>, 
from what I hear.</p>

<p>If I plan to keep the 2.5" hard drive in this wonderful T43's hard 
drive bay, I can get the <a 
href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/UltraBay_Slim_HDD_Adapter">UltraBay 
Slim HDD adapater</a> (<a 
href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-46455">Lenovo</a>, 
IBM PN 62P4554) for around $50.</p>

<p>I'll try this, I think.</p>

<h3>Won't you miss your CD-RW/DVD drive?</h3>

<p>Some notes on American Fascism:</p>

<ul>
<li>People say this: 

"This kid got to say his piece, and then started ranting, the police 
TRIED (leila take note here) to escort him out calmly but he resisted 
and continued ranting. This is the sort of behavior that can incite a 
riot" when a kid is being tasered for asking a question and being a 
brat.

</li><li>But what are we to do when mainstream pre-Presidential 
candidate Rudy Giuliani is <a 
href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2D9173CF933A15750C0A962958260">
on the record as being a fascist</a>?

</li><li>And what are we to do when mainstream political pundit Thomas 
Friedman is for <a 
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7qkZ_w2oxM&eurl= ">meaningless 
wars based on lies</a>?
</li></ul>

<p>Presumably, we should taser more people who are asking why they're 
being arrested (<a 
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqAVvlyVbag">vid1</a>, <a 
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaiWCS10C5s">vid2</a>) while a 
former presidential candidate <em>just keeps talking as if nothing's 
wrong</em>, and <a 
href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/05/16/romney-guantanamo/">lock up 
more innocent people in jails where they can't ask why</a>.  It's the 
mainstream.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>I am making calls from and receiving calls to my Neo 1973.  This is 
wonderful.  I can do it thanks to the porting of QTopia to the FIC Neo 
1973 platform!  There was this <a 
href="http://trolltech.com/company/newsroom/announcements/press.2007-09-17.9260755578">press 
release</a> as well as live, nude downloadable source and binaries as 
described in <a 
href="http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/device-owners/2007-September/000490.html">this 
mailing list thread</a>.</p>

<p>Seth David Schoen brought up a good point: the press release mentions 
that they're Freeing their DRM implementation, too.  That silenced my 
excitement until I could learn more.</p>

<p>Here's a meaningless (in a formal sense) personal testimonial from 
the developer who says he did most of the porting of QTopia to the 
Neo:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;paulproteus> ljp, I saw that the announcement said you guys were GPLing your DRM implementation.
&lt;paulproteus> Does the binary you gave out include that DRM software?
&lt;ljp> not DRM, but SXE
&lt;ljp> and the neo does not configured with SXE
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>SXE is <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/sxe.html">an 
on-phone sandboxing system</a> for untrusted software, and the Neo 
doesn't use it anyway.  I feel safe enough that I can go to sleep, at 
least.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say Alan, a regular citizen with no income (at least, that's 
who I was a few months ago) has a website. Let's say I'm agitated about 
some issue of national concern, and I want to get my readers to contact 
their Congresscritter.  Let's say those readers don't even know who they 
elected.  How do they do it?  That person is missing two crucial pieces 
of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who the Senator or Representative is, and</li>
<li>how to contact that person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shouldn't the information of which parts of the country are 
represented by be information anyone can use to promote democratic 
engatement?</p>

<p>Okay, so the Senator name is easy - those are two per state, easy to 
look up.  And f you look at the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of 
Representatives</a> website, they let you put in your ZIP code and tell 
you who represents you.  If house.gov needs more information, it will 
ask.</p>

<p>But that only tells you <em>who</em>, not <em>how</em>.  Different 
Congress-people want to be contacted in different ways - phone, web 
form, or email.  It would be nice to have a publicly-available database 
of that.  But who will do the hard work to maintain it?  And if it's a 
web form, then those are different on a per-representatve basis.  And 
when Bob uses Alan's website to contact his member of Congress, 
Alan would prefer to that Bob always see Alan's page templates, advice 
for what to put in the fields, and so on.  So this information should be 
not only available, it should be machine-usable.</p>

<h3>A proposal</h3>

<p>So here's a proposal for how to maintain this information:</p>

<p>First of all, a technical note: All the data extraction described 
below can either be done by a central server that is asked every time 
someone wants to know, or client-side code that runs on Bob's 
computer/browser that does the extraction.  The advantage of the latter 
is that it's much harder to block as well as more impressive in the 
server logs at house.gov.</p>

<h4>Who's my Rep or Senator?</h4>

<p>It is always going to be easy (in a technical sense) to determine 
which field on <a href="http://www.house.gov/">house.gov</a> is the ZIP 
code entry field.  (If Bob doesn't know his ZIP, you can just look it up 
with e.g. the USPS website.)  The responses will be easy to parse, too; 
just see, of the results returned, which ones actually are a known 
possible choice according to e.g. Wikipedia.</p>

<h4>How do I contact him/her?</h4>

<p>All Senators and Representatives do provide web forms.  In general 
they have a common set of fields, and then some have more advanced ones.  
The central component is just listing which form fields are required; 
Bob's computer/web browser can just dynamically create a form that 
matches, all within the look of Bob's site.</p>

<p>If you want to store the results for performance reasons, you don't 
have to worry about storing it for every possible location or 
representative.  Just cache it once a client requests for about a day, 
I'd say.</p>

<h4>What about reliability?</h4>

<p>What to do if the House of Representatives website (or its form 
handling) is not online at the moment?  Recall there are two ways to 
architect the form submission: Either Bob's computer could directly 
submit to the form on his representative's web site, or he could submit 
to a central computer that would do all the submissions.  The advantage 
of the latter is that the central computer can enqueue form submissions 
that were problematic just like mail servers queue email.</p>

<p>In fact, the same strategy could be used for the form itself!  
Imagine that Bob wants to submit to his rep's web form but house.gov is 
unavailable.  If the central server doesn't have the form cached, then 
at least

<h3>Why go through all this trouble?</h3>

<p>Well, as a public service.  It would be nice if anyone could run 
their own Action Alert site without having to pay or otherwise submit to 
the will of third parties.</p>

<h3>Exactly how much trouble is it?</h3>

<p>As I've described it, the whole system is automated.  Optionally, a 
human can call representatives and see how they like to be contacted.  
If each conversation takes about five minutes, and there are fewer than 
600 Senators and Representatives, it takes only 3,000 minutes or 50 
man-hours tops to contact everyone and ask their preferred means of 
contact.  This can be done in one shot, or it could be done by 
volunteers spread across the country.</p>

<p>Now, it would be <strong>really interesting</strong> to apply this on 
a state level.  Cheap and widely-used action alerts to state 
senators would make for much more interest from state legislatures 
in what their constituents think....</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/organize/inbox-zero.html">Inbox Zero</a>
       </h1>
		
<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Inbox Zero</a> suggests 
keeping my INBOX to having zero items in it.  Recently I received an 
email that was informative rather than had information I needed to act 
on, and it struck me: Why <em>do</em> I use my INBOX as an archive?</p>

<p>So I'm going to try this idea out.  (I first heard of it while 
surfing <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a>.)  I've 
been using IMAP labels in (al)pine in a similar fashion to the way 
Merlin Mann suggests using email, but the big difference is that when an 
email is dealt with, I don't make it visually go away.  So sometimes 
I dig through INBOX to see what I forgot to deal with.</p>

<p>I actually found the Inbox Zero web site very hard to use.  Here are 
the lessons I've extracted so far:</p>

<h3>INBOX is a place emails go before you act on them</h3>

<p>The <a 
href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/02/18/quick-tips-on-processing-your-email-inbox/">available 
action space is</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>delete (Okay, I'm not going to do that)</li>
<li>archive (>90% of my mail is informative rather than actionable)</li>
<li>defer (save to reply-to-me for later sprints)</li>
<li>generate an action from it (save to act-on-me for later sprints)</li>
<li>reply right now (if it'll take <2 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disable auto-check</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/15/email-dash/">"Are you 
checking the email, Yakov, or is it checking you?"</a></p>

<p>This means both disabling my instinct to auto-check as well as the 
technology that auto-checks every minute.  Every 30m or 60m is okay.  
I'm not quite sure what to do about the system monitoring alerts, 
though.</p>

<h3>Do email in dashes</h3>

<p>Defragment the day; see the Yakov link above.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say you run Ubuntu but want the freshest package of something 
from Debian Unstable.  Or you run Debian Stable and you want some crazy 
multimedia package that only Ubuntu packages.</p>

<p>For many packages, it is pretty easy to "backport" them between 
distributions or between releases.  Let's say you run Ubuntu or Debian 
stable and you want the latest version of my alpine package.  Here's 
what you do:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Make sure you have an appropriate deb-src line</h3>

<p>Backporting is the process of taking <em>source 
packages</em> and compiling them on your Debian(-like) system.  The 
easiest way to find Debian "source packages" is the same way you find 
Debian "binary packages": apt-get and its configuration.</p>

<p>Make sure you have this line in /etc/apt/sources.list:</p>

<blockquote>deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main</blockquote>

<h3>Step 2: apt-get update</h3>

<h3>Step 3: install "apt-src"</h3>

<p>Just do 'sudo aptitude install apt-src'.  apt-src is a helper program 
that makes compiling source packages easy.  It's not necessary, but 
it prevents you from having to type too many commands.</p>

<h3>Step 4: apt-src -bi install $package</h3>

<p>If you wanted to install 'alpine', just do:</p>

<blockquote>apt-src -bi install alpine</blockquote>

<p>The "b" stands for "build", the "i" stands for "install the resulting 
package", and the word "install" means "download the source for alpine 
as found in a Debian source line from sources.list".  apt-src will 
"install" the source into the current directory, make sure you have all 
the required packages to build the package (a process called "satisfying 
the build dependencies"), build it, and install the resulting .debs.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Run the new program</h3>

<p>You should be done now!</p>

<p>Mark Pilgrim wrote a lot a year or so ago about his switching from Mac 
OS X to GNU/Linux.  One small bit says:</p>

<blockquote><a 
href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">if 
I bought a new Mac, I would be subsidizing the development of an 
operating system that contains code whose sole purpose is to lock me 
into a specific hardware platform. I realize that most people don’t look 
at it that way, but there it is.</a></blockquote>

<p>This is as good a start as any to the MMM section of asheesh.org.  I 
currently have a full-time job, and in this world, when you fund 
something, you are voting with your dollars for that thing's continued 
existence.  That's as true for Apple's lock-in technology as it is for 
AT&T's illegal wiretapping program.</p>

<p>I claim to think that consumer freedom is important, that software 
freedoms are important, and that the environment is worth saving rather 
than trashing.  In that case, if I'm ethical or at least not a 
hypocrite, I should put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>I read a few years ago about some remarks by some guy at some open 
source software conference.  A young-looking dude wearing a suit and a 
weird expression and holding his arm <a 
href="http://luke.francl.org/lessig-challenge/">asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote> How many people have given to EFF more money than they have 
given to their local telecom to give them shitty DSL service? See? Four. 
How many people have given more money to EFF than they give each year to 
support the monopoly--to support the other side? </blockquote>

<p>(For context, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a non-profit 
whose sole focus is legal and lobbying action to protect digital 
rights.)</p>

<p>For years, I had been thinking in terms of this challenge, but I knew 
I didn't have the kind of income and spending money where my actions 
would be substantial.  In fact, I was in a tough spot like lots of 
people with very litle money: You have needs, and then wants, then 
somewhere hazy after that there's a planet to think of.</p>

<p>Well, now I'm a rich man - I have a job that pays me 
<em>thousands</em> of dollars every year.  Those thousands of dollars 
get to go somewhere, and I get to pick.  (Later on I would learn that 
this guy <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lessig</a> who raised this 
issue was an interesting guy in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#39">other ways</a>.)</p>

<p>When you vote with your dollars that a movie industry that sues its 
customers should continue existing, or when you vote with your dollars 
to Microsoft that their illegal tactics are okay, your dollars will turn 
around and be used (quite literally) to oppress others.  I say, not in 
my name.</p>

<p>As Mark Pilgrim noted: "[M]ost people don’t look at it that way, but 
there it is."  I'm creating this section to make sure there's a record in 
public that I started down this path so, if I ever want to abandon it, I 
can see how far I've come.</p>

<p>I just read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082100146_2.html">Hydrocodone Abuse on Rise in Appalachia</a>.  Some selections:</p>

<blockquote>Dotson has been off drugs since a religious experience in 2001.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.lyriki.com/Bad_Religion:52_Seconds">Maybe God is just a chemical fiction.</a></p>

<blockquote>"When I started in this field, the primary client was involved with alcohol," says David Bailey, a community resource specialist with the West Virginia Prevention Resource Center.  "I wish it were still alcohol."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Peter Cohen, medical director of the Maryland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration. . . pointed out that while hydrocodone abuse has grown slightly in Maryland since 2002, it is still far less commonly abused than street drugs like heroin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"You've got three choices," [Dotson] said. "You either die, go to prison or get saved. Mostly, people around here are dying."</blockquote>
<p>Those quotes speak for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>The most commonly prescribed product combines hydrocodone and acetaminophen, which is marketed under brand names like Vicodin and Lortab.</blockquote>
<p>All that Vicodin-selling spam is suddenly so much sadder now.</p>

<blockquote>The DEA is considering moving drugs containing hydrocodone from being classified as so-called Schedule III drugs to being Schedule II drugs.</blockquote>
