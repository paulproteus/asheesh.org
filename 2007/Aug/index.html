        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/politics/contact%20congress.html">Contacting Congress</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say Alan, a regular citizen with no income (at least, that's 
who I was a few months ago) has a website. Let's say I'm agitated about 
some issue of national concern, and I want to get my readers to contact 
their Congresscritter.  Let's say those readers don't even know who they 
elected.  How do they do it?  That person is missing two crucial pieces 
of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who the Senator or Representative is, and</li>
<li>how to contact that person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shouldn't the information of which parts of the country are 
represented by be information anyone can use to promote democratic 
engatement?</p>

<p>Okay, so the Senator name is easy - those are two per state, easy to 
look up.  And f you look at the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of 
Representatives</a> website, they let you put in your ZIP code and tell 
you who represents you.  If house.gov needs more information, it will 
ask.</p>

<p>But that only tells you <em>who</em>, not <em>how</em>.  Different 
Congress-people want to be contacted in different ways - phone, web 
form, or email.  It would be nice to have a publicly-available database 
of that.  But who will do the hard work to maintain it?  And if it's a 
web form, then those are different on a per-representatve basis.  And 
when Bob uses Alan's website to contact his member of Congress, 
Alan would prefer to that Bob always see Alan's page templates, advice 
for what to put in the fields, and so on.  So this information should be 
not only available, it should be machine-usable.</p>

<h3>A proposal</h3>

<p>So here's a proposal for how to maintain this information:</p>

<p>First of all, a technical note: All the data extraction described 
below can either be done by a central server that is asked every time 
someone wants to know, or client-side code that runs on Bob's 
computer/browser that does the extraction.  The advantage of the latter 
is that it's much harder to block as well as more impressive in the 
server logs at house.gov.</p>

<h4>Who's my Rep or Senator?</h4>

<p>It is always going to be easy (in a technical sense) to determine 
which field on <a href="http://www.house.gov/">house.gov</a> is the ZIP 
code entry field.  (If Bob doesn't know his ZIP, you can just look it up 
with e.g. the USPS website.)  The responses will be easy to parse, too; 
just see, of the results returned, which ones actually are a known 
possible choice according to e.g. Wikipedia.</p>

<h4>How do I contact him/her?</h4>

<p>All Senators and Representatives do provide web forms.  In general 
they have a common set of fields, and then some have more advanced ones.  
The central component is just listing which form fields are required; 
Bob's computer/web browser can just dynamically create a form that 
matches, all within the look of Bob's site.</p>

<p>If you want to store the results for performance reasons, you don't 
have to worry about storing it for every possible location or 
representative.  Just cache it once a client requests for about a day, 
I'd say.</p>

<h4>What about reliability?</h4>

<p>What to do if the House of Representatives website (or its form 
handling) is not online at the moment?  Recall there are two ways to 
architect the form submission: Either Bob's computer could directly 
submit to the form on his representative's web site, or he could submit 
to a central computer that would do all the submissions.  The advantage 
of the latter is that the central computer can enqueue form submissions 
that were problematic just like mail servers queue email.</p>

<p>In fact, the same strategy could be used for the form itself!  
Imagine that Bob wants to submit to his rep's web form but house.gov is 
unavailable.  If the central server doesn't have the form cached, then 
at least

<h3>Why go through all this trouble?</h3>

<p>Well, as a public service.  It would be nice if anyone could run 
their own Action Alert site without having to pay or otherwise submit to 
the will of third parties.</p>

<h3>Exactly how much trouble is it?</h3>

<p>As I've described it, the whole system is automated.  Optionally, a 
human can call representatives and see how they like to be contacted.  
If each conversation takes about five minutes, and there are fewer than 
600 Senators and Representatives, it takes only 3,000 minutes or 50 
man-hours tops to contact everyone and ask their preferred means of 
contact.  This can be done in one shot, or it could be done by 
volunteers spread across the country.</p>

<p>Now, it would be <strong>really interesting</strong> to apply this on 
a state level.  Cheap and widely-used action alerts to state 
senators would make for much more interest from state legislatures 
in what their constituents think....</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/organize/inbox-zero.html">Inbox Zero</a>
       </h1>
		
<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Inbox Zero</a> suggests 
keeping my INBOX to having zero items in it.  Recently I received an 
email that was informative rather than had information I needed to act 
on, and it struck me: Why <em>do</em> I use my INBOX as an archive?</p>

<p>So I'm going to try this idea out.  (I first heard of it while 
surfing <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a>.)  I've 
been using IMAP labels in (al)pine in a similar fashion to the way 
Merlin Mann suggests using email, but the big difference is that when an 
email is dealt with, I don't make it visually go away.  So sometimes 
I dig through INBOX to see what I forgot to deal with.</p>

<p>I actually found the Inbox Zero web site very hard to use.  Here are 
the lessons I've extracted so far:</p>

<h3>INBOX is a place emails go before you act on them</h3>

<p>The <a 
href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/02/18/quick-tips-on-processing-your-email-inbox/">available 
action space is</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>delete (Okay, I'm not going to do that)</li>
<li>archive (>90% of my mail is informative rather than actionable)</li>
<li>defer (save to reply-to-me for later sprints)</li>
<li>generate an action from it (save to act-on-me for later sprints)</li>
<li>reply right now (if it'll take <2 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disable auto-check</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/15/email-dash/">"Are you 
checking the email, Yakov, or is it checking you?"</a></p>

<p>This means both disabling my instinct to auto-check as well as the 
technology that auto-checks every minute.  Every 30m or 60m is okay.  
I'm not quite sure what to do about the system monitoring alerts, 
though.</p>

<h3>Do email in dashes</h3>

<p>Defragment the day; see the Yakov link above.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say you run Ubuntu but want the freshest package of something 
from Debian Unstable.  Or you run Debian Stable and you want some crazy 
multimedia package that only Ubuntu packages.</p>

<p>For many packages, it is pretty easy to "backport" them between 
distributions or between releases.  Let's say you run Ubuntu or Debian 
stable and you want the latest version of my alpine package.  Here's 
what you do:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Make sure you have an appropriate deb-src line</h3>

<p>Backporting is the process of taking <em>source 
packages</em> and compiling them on your Debian(-like) system.  The 
easiest way to find Debian "source packages" is the same way you find 
Debian "binary packages": apt-get and its configuration.</p>

<p>Make sure you have this line in /etc/apt/sources.list:</p>

<blockquote>deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main</blockquote>

<h3>Step 2: apt-get update</h3>

<h3>Step 3: install "apt-src"</h3>

<p>Just do 'sudo aptitude install apt-src'.  apt-src is a helper program 
that makes compiling source packages easy.  It's not necessary, but 
it prevents you from having to type too many commands.</p>

<h3>Step 4: apt-src -bi install $package</h3>

<p>If you wanted to install 'alpine', just do:</p>

<blockquote>apt-src -bi install alpine</blockquote>

<p>The "b" stands for "build", the "i" stands for "install the resulting 
package", and the word "install" means "download the source for alpine 
as found in a Debian source line from sources.list".  apt-src will 
"install" the source into the current directory, make sure you have all 
the required packages to build the package (a process called "satisfying 
the build dependencies"), build it, and install the resulting .debs.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Run the new program</h3>

<p>You should be done now!</p>

<blockquote>"When I started in this field, the primary client was involved with alcohol," says David Bailey, a community resource specialist with the West Virginia Prevention Resource Center.  "I wish it were still alcohol."</blockquote>

<p>Mark Pilgrim wrote a lot a year or so ago about his switching from Mac 
OS X to GNU/Linux.  One small bit says:</p>

<blockquote><a 
href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">if 
I bought a new Mac, I would be subsidizing the development of an 
operating system that contains code whose sole purpose is to lock me 
into a specific hardware platform. I realize that most people don’t look 
at it that way, but there it is.</a></blockquote>

<p>This is as good a start as any to the MMM section of asheesh.org.  I 
currently have a full-time job, and in this world, when you fund 
something, you are voting with your dollars for that thing's continued 
existence.  That's as true for Apple's lock-in technology as it is for 
AT&T's illegal wiretapping program.</p>

<p>I claim to think that consumer freedom is important, that software 
freedoms are important, and that the environment is worth saving rather 
than trashing.  In that case, if I'm ethical or at least not a 
hypocrite, I should put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>I read a few years ago about some remarks by some guy at some open 
source software conference.  A young-looking dude wearing a suit and a 
weird expression and holding his arm <a 
href="http://luke.francl.org/lessig-challenge/">asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote> How many people have given to EFF more money than they have 
given to their local telecom to give them shitty DSL service? See? Four. 
How many people have given more money to EFF than they give each year to 
support the monopoly--to support the other side? </blockquote>

<p>(For context, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a non-profit 
whose sole focus is legal and lobbying action to protect digital 
rights.)</p>

<p>For years, I had been thinking in terms of this challenge, but I knew 
I didn't have the kind of income and spending money where my actions 
would be substantial.  In fact, I was in a tough spot like lots of 
people with very litle money: You have needs, and then wants, then 
somewhere hazy after that there's a planet to think of.</p>

<p>Well, now I'm a rich man - I have a job that pays me 
<em>thousands</em> of dollars every year.  Those thousands of dollars 
get to go somewhere, and I get to pick.  (Later on I would learn that 
this guy <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lessig</a> who raised this 
issue was an interesting guy in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#39">other ways</a>.)</p>

<p>When you vote with your dollars that a movie industry that sues its 
customers should continue existing, or when you vote with your dollars 
to Microsoft that their illegal tactics are okay, your dollars will turn 
around and be used (quite literally) to oppress others.  I say, not in 
my name.</p>

<p>As Mark Pilgrim noted: "[M]ost people don’t look at it that way, but 
there it is."  I'm creating this section to make sure there's a record in 
public that I started down this path so, if I ever want to abandon it, I 
can see how far I've come.</p>

<p>This is like a new year's resolution: Starting today, I'll chronicle 
how much money of my money I give to oil companies, monpolists in the 
entertainment industry, and other groups whose activities I think are 
bad for humans.  I'll also tally the money I give to people doing work 
that I think is good that hopefully offsets that.</p>

<p>See the note about it for details.  In the future, hopefully some 
smart application will put a tally of these stats on the right side.</p>

<p>I'm Asheesh Laroia.  I want as many people as possible to have as much 
information as possible and be able to be as free as possible to act on 
that information.  I use "information" broadly to include, for example, 
the current weather, the math necessary to predict future weather, and 
computer software that does such calculations.  I once thought that this 
"information" should include information about people, but now I'm more 
confused about that.<p>

<p>Lately I've had to pay bills, so I did what I always do when I have a 
problem: I thought about computers.  Right now, I <a

Commons</a> doing just that.  Creative Commons is a non-profit in San 
Francisco that I love because it works to make culture more available.<p>
