In the same vein as "Barbie in a Blender", I like the phrase "barbie 
queue".  It serves as a convenient alternative to the word "barbecue" 
without sacrificing the hilarity of ubiquitous bbq.

<p>This is like a new year's resolution: Starting today, I'll chronicle 
how much money of my money I give to oil companies, monpolists in the 
entertainment industry, and other groups whose activities I think are 
bad for humans.  I'll also tally the money I give to people doing work 
that I think is good that hopefully offsets that.</p>

<p>See the note about it for details.  In the future, hopefully some 
smart application will put a tally of these stats on the right side.</p>

       </h1>
		
<p>I'm Asheesh Laroia.  I want as many people as possible to have as much 
information as possible and be able to be as free as possible to act on 
that information.  I use "information" broadly to include, for example, 
the current weather, the math necessary to predict future weather, and 
computer software that does such calculations.  I once thought that this 
"information" should include information about people, but now I'm more 
confused about that.<p>

<p>Lately I've had to pay bills, so I did what I always do when I have a 
problem: I thought about computers.  Right now, I <a 
href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#82">work at Creative 
Commons</a> doing just that.  Creative Commons is a non-profit in San 
Francisco that I love because it works to make culture more available.<p>

<p>I just read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082100146_2.html">Hydrocodone Abuse on Rise in Appalachia</a>.  Some selections:</p>

<blockquote>Dotson has been off drugs since a religious experience in 2001.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.lyriki.com/Bad_Religion:52_Seconds">Maybe God is just a chemical fiction.</a></p>

<blockquote>"When I started in this field, the primary client was involved with alcohol," says David Bailey, a community resource specialist with the West Virginia Prevention Resource Center.  "I wish it were still alcohol."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Peter Cohen, medical director of the Maryland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration. . . pointed out that while hydrocodone abuse has grown slightly in Maryland since 2002, it is still far less commonly abused than street drugs like heroin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"You've got three choices," [Dotson] said. "You either die, go to prison or get saved. Mostly, people around here are dying."</blockquote>
<p>Those quotes speak for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>The most commonly prescribed product combines hydrocodone and acetaminophen, which is marketed under brand names like Vicodin and Lortab.</blockquote>
<p>All that Vicodin-selling spam is suddenly so much sadder now.</p>

<blockquote>The DEA is considering moving drugs containing hydrocodone from being classified as so-called Schedule III drugs to being Schedule II drugs.</blockquote>

<p>Mark Pilgrim wrote a lot a year or so ago about his switching from Mac 
OS X to GNU/Linux.  One small bit says:</p>

<blockquote><a 
href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">if 
I bought a new Mac, I would be subsidizing the development of an 
operating system that contains code whose sole purpose is to lock me 
into a specific hardware platform. I realize that most people don’t look 
at it that way, but there it is.</a></blockquote>

<p>This is as good a start as any to the MMM section of asheesh.org.  I 
currently have a full-time job, and in this world, when you fund 
something, you are voting with your dollars for that thing's continued 
existence.  That's as true for Apple's lock-in technology as it is for 
AT&T's illegal wiretapping program.</p>

<p>I claim to think that consumer freedom is important, that software 
freedoms are important, and that the environment is worth saving rather 
than trashing.  In that case, if I'm ethical or at least not a 
hypocrite, I should put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>I read a few years ago about some remarks by some guy at some open 
source software conference.  A young-looking dude wearing a suit and a 
weird expression and holding his arm <a 
href="http://luke.francl.org/lessig-challenge/">asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote> How many people have given to EFF more money than they have 
given to their local telecom to give them shitty DSL service? See? Four. 
How many people have given more money to EFF than they give each year to 
support the monopoly--to support the other side? </blockquote>

<p>(For context, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a non-profit 
whose sole focus is legal and lobbying action to protect digital 
rights.)</p>

<p>For years, I had been thinking in terms of this challenge, but I knew 
I didn't have the kind of income and spending money where my actions 
would be substantial.  In fact, I was in a tough spot like lots of 
people with very litle money: You have needs, and then wants, then 
somewhere hazy after that there's a planet to think of.</p>

<p>Well, now I'm a rich man - I have a job that pays me 
<em>thousands</em> of dollars every year.  Those thousands of dollars 
get to go somewhere, and I get to pick.  (Later on I would learn that 
this guy <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lessig</a> who raised this 
issue was an interesting guy in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#39">other ways</a>.)</p>

<p>When you vote with your dollars that a movie industry that sues its 
customers should continue existing, or when you vote with your dollars 
to Microsoft that their illegal tactics are okay, your dollars will turn 
around and be used (quite literally) to oppress others.  I say, not in 
my name.</p>

<p>As Mark Pilgrim noted: "[M]ost people don’t look at it that way, but 
there it is."  I'm creating this section to make sure there's a record in 
public that I started down this path so, if I ever want to abandon it, I 
can see how far I've come.</p>
