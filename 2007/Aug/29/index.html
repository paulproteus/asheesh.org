       </h1>
		
<p>Let's say Alan, a regular citizen with no income (at least, that's 
who I was a few months ago) has a website. Let's say I'm agitated about 
some issue of national concern, and I want to get my readers to contact 
their Congresscritter.  Let's say those readers don't even know who they 
elected.  How do they do it?  That person is missing two crucial pieces 
of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who the Senator or Representative is, and</li>
<li>how to contact that person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shouldn't the information of which parts of the country are 
represented by be information anyone can use to promote democratic 
engatement?</p>

<p>Okay, so the Senator name is easy - those are two per state, easy to 
look up.  And f you look at the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of 
Representatives</a> website, they let you put in your ZIP code and tell 
you who represents you.  If house.gov needs more information, it will 
ask.</p>

<p>But that only tells you <em>who</em>, not <em>how</em>.  Different 
Congress-people want to be contacted in different ways - phone, web 
form, or email.  It would be nice to have a publicly-available database 
of that.  But who will do the hard work to maintain it?  And if it's a 
web form, then those are different on a per-representatve basis.  And 
when Bob uses Alan's website to contact his member of Congress, 
Alan would prefer to that Bob always see Alan's page templates, advice 
for what to put in the fields, and so on.  So this information should be 
not only available, it should be machine-usable.</p>

<h3>A proposal</h3>

<p>So here's a proposal for how to maintain this information:</p>

<p>First of all, a technical note: All the data extraction described 
below can either be done by a central server that is asked every time 
someone wants to know, or client-side code that runs on Bob's 
computer/browser that does the extraction.  The advantage of the latter 
is that it's much harder to block as well as more impressive in the 
server logs at house.gov.</p>

<h4>Who's my Rep or Senator?</h4>

<p>It is always going to be easy (in a technical sense) to determine 
which field on <a href="http://www.house.gov/">house.gov</a> is the ZIP 
code entry field.  (If Bob doesn't know his ZIP, you can just look it up 
with e.g. the USPS website.)  The responses will be easy to parse, too; 
just see, of the results returned, which ones actually are a known 
possible choice according to e.g. Wikipedia.</p>

<h4>How do I contact him/her?</h4>

<p>All Senators and Representatives do provide web forms.  In general 
they have a common set of fields, and then some have more advanced ones.  
The central component is just listing which form fields are required; 
Bob's computer/web browser can just dynamically create a form that 
matches, all within the look of Bob's site.</p>

<p>If you want to store the results for performance reasons, you don't 
have to worry about storing it for every possible location or 
representative.  Just cache it once a client requests for about a day, 
I'd say.</p>

<h4>What about reliability?</h4>

<p>What to do if the House of Representatives website (or its form 
handling) is not online at the moment?  Recall there are two ways to 
architect the form submission: Either Bob's computer could directly 
submit to the form on his representative's web site, or he could submit 
to a central computer that would do all the submissions.  The advantage 
of the latter is that the central computer can enqueue form submissions 
that were problematic just like mail servers queue email.</p>

<p>In fact, the same strategy could be used for the form itself!  
Imagine that Bob wants to submit to his rep's web form but house.gov is 
unavailable.  If the central server doesn't have the form cached, then 
at least

<h3>Why go through all this trouble?</h3>

<p>Well, as a public service.  It would be nice if anyone could run 
their own Action Alert site without having to pay or otherwise submit to 
the will of third parties.</p>

<h3>Exactly how much trouble is it?</h3>

<p>As I've described it, the whole system is automated.  Optionally, a 
human can call representatives and see how they like to be contacted.  
If each conversation takes about five minutes, and there are fewer than 
600 Senators and Representatives, it takes only 3,000 minutes or 50 
man-hours tops to contact everyone and ask their preferred means of 
contact.  This can be done in one shot, or it could be done by 
volunteers spread across the country.</p>

<p>Now, it would be <strong>really interesting</strong> to apply this on 
a state level.  Cheap and widely-used action alerts to state 
senators would make for much more interest from state legislatures 
in what their constituents think....</p>
