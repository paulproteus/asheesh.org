They probably wanted to make sure it was accidental and not some denial of service attack (i.e., newsworthy).

Were say Anonymous to jump on us for some unforseeable reason, it

</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Anonymous should start submitting (broken) patches to the Wikimedia operations team, in the hopes
one of them lands and causes the site to go down, so it can get more press.

		<p>Living in the Boston area, I've had the chance to spend time with
the lovely maintainers of the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted project</a>.
</p><p>Twisted is an event-driven network programming framework in Python. It's also
a community of people for whom software is never good enough -- and they're right.
</p><p>I visited the <a href="http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2011/12/november-sprint-report.html">Twisted November sprint</a>
at the Smarterer.com office a few weeks ago and reviewed a ticket. So now I am
on the
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/?time=2011-11-01">Twisted high scores list</a>
for November!
</p><p>It was one of the most rewarding short periods of time I've ever spent
contributing to an open source project. I took someone's contribution
and turned it into a patch, and also gave some feedback. This counted as
reviewing a ticket, for which I was immediately and strongly socially
rewarded: J.P. (exarkun) turned  to me and say, "Thanks for contributing
to Twisted."
</p><p>An IRC bot pinged me with a note saying my ticket review
was complete. And now I appear in the high scores list for November!

</p><p>You can see a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-cDorXHO5U&feature=player_detailpage#t=2505s">video of Jonathan Blandford talking about it</a>, where he says:

We're giving demos of GNOME3, and the new desktop

So if you're interested in it, please come by and take a look!

I went down to the Partner Pavillion and spent over an hour 
with Jonathan and the RHEL7 demo they had running. Besides 
a new wallpaper (Which was very beautiful BTW) they were 
running Gnome 3.5 on the demo, an the only other major 
changes were a few more account service providers and chat 
plugins (like Sametime, Yahoo, and stuff). It did not 
handle multi-monitors with different resolutions worth a 
flip (but it is beta after all). This is when I asked him 
if they planned on putting XFCE or LXDE or even Cinnamon in 
the Extra's channel, and they very confidently said they 
would not be in there. They had no plans to offer them.

       </h1>
		<p>I've had the honor of working with Will Kahn-Greene at the
<a href="http://pculture.org">Participatory Culture Foundation</a> recently.
He works on the <a href="http://getmiro.com/">Miro desktop video player</a>.
</p><p>He also maintains the PCF's wiki. It runs MediaWiki. It was being spammed
to smithereens. In this screenshot, you see WillKahnGreene's account

<h3 id="w_before">Before</h3>
<p><img src="http://bluesock.org/~willg/bimages/recent_changes_before.png" />
</p>
<h3 id="w_after">After</h3>
<p>As of about a week ago, all the bots can do is create user accounts. That
means Will doesn't have to go blocking them and deleting the content they uploaded:
</p><p><img src="http://bluesock.org/~willg/bimages/recent_changes_after.png" />
</p>
<h3 id="w_the-exceedingly-simple-antispam-strategy">The exceedingly simple antispam strategy</h3>
<p>You might be wondering how he did it. Here's what it took, in terms of policy:
</p>
<ul><li> Permit anonymous edits to the wiki. (This is essential for <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNature">WikiNature</a>.)
</li><li> If you are uploading a file, you must be logged in with an account that has confirmed its email address.
</li><li> If you are adding a new URL to a page, you must be logged in with an account that has confirmed its email address.
</li></ul>
<p>Will had the patience to listen to me and try a few of my ideas, most of which still let some spam through.
</p><p>Then we came up with the idea of 
hacking some changes into the CAPTCHA plugin to enforce the above policy.
MediaWiki has a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights">permissions system</a> (they call it "user rights").
We use the user-rights system to restrict file uploads, but
<i>crucially</i> there is no built-in way to restrict who can add URLs.
</p><p>So Will had to write some very simple code that, effectively, adds an
<i>addurl</i> permission to MediaWiki. He did it extending the ConfirmEdit extension.
It's easy to install; you can find
<a href="http://pculture.org/wguaraldi/emailconfirmednoncaptcha/">instructions on his project page</a>.
He wrote <a href="http://bluesock.org/~willg/blog/miro/spam_reduction.html">a blog post about it</a>.
</p><p>As far as I can tell, <i>anyone who runs a public MediaWiki install should configure</i>
the wiki this way<i>.</i>
</p><p>Seriously.
</p><p>If you look at the long, sprawling MediaWiki documentation page about restricting spam,
it contains all sorts of nonsense. Ignore it. Just
<a href="http://pculture.org/wguaraldi/emailconfirmednoncaptcha/">do what Will did</a>.

advocacy-free

My writing used to be heavily philosophical, with lots of advocacy and questioning. I still consider the why of things much more meaningful than the how, but it's time to focus on the how 
rather than the why. I'm making this little writing place a "no trolling zone." I will try to avoid preaching, and the obvious corollary is that I will also avoid worrying about whether people 
agree or disagree. Instead, I will try to simply share little pieces of code as it comes to me.

There is no advocacy on here. I frequent a few scuba diving forums. One annoying part of scuba culture is that it can be very polarizing. A bunch of people over here say there is only One True 
Way to dive, right down to using the exact same equipment as each other. Another bunch of people over there disregard the conventional wisdom and choose to dive solo, attracting criticism from 
young and old. The forums discovered a long time ago that running flame wars simply drove members away, so they have instituted "no trolling" zones within their boards, places where people can 
discuss the how of solo diving, or sidemounting, or DIR, without getting into a battle of whether such a thing is a good idea or not.

</div>
</div>
<p>My friend Venkatesh, pictured above, is going to bike four thousand miles, all the way across the continental US, from Baltimore to Portland. He's doing it to raise money for the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults. I'm writing this because I want you to <a href="http://4kforcancer.org/profiles/venkatesh-srinivas/">donate money to his cause</a>. He's a DragonFly BSD developer, loves bikes, and your donation could make a big difference.</p>
<p>I first met Venkatesh through the Johns Hopkins computer club, an <a href="http://acm.jhu.edu/">ACM chapter</a>. I was the head of the club, and he had just started his career at Hopkins. He was looking for advice on running <a href="http://brickwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">Brickwiki</a>, the LEGO encyclopedia. Quickly, I became his friend; in that time, I've learned the following things about him.</p>
<ul>
<li>He is friendly!</li>
<li>He believes in science; beyond just writing <a href="http://ops101.org/">sharp code</a>, he likes to <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hackers/2010-December/033864.html">ask</a> <a href="http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2011-03/msg00016.html">questions</a>.</li>
<li>He is melodramatically attracted to the power and complexity of biology. (The above quote about cancer are his words.)</li>
<li>He wants to do something to make cancer less of a killer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the years since I graduated from Hopkins, I've been impressed by Venkatesh's ongoing curiosity and contributions to open source projects like DragonFly. I'm honored to have this chance to help him bike across the country for a good cause.</p>
<p>Here is a quick word about the <a href="http://4kforcancer.org/">4K for cancer</a> effort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2002, groups of college students have undertaken a 70 day,  4000+ mile summer bike ride across the United States with the goal of  offering hope, inspiration and support to cancer communities along the  way.</p>
<p>This past summer was our 10th year of cycling across the country as  76 volunteers rode along three different routes:  Baltimore to San  Francisco, Baltimore to Portland, and Baltimore to Seattle.  Our riders  raised a combined $476,000 to support organizations and individuals in  the fight against cancer.
