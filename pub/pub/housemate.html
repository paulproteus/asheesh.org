<h3> The room</h3>
<br
/>The room itself is 82 square feet (8' by 10' 3").&nbsp; There is also a closet of 3' 4" by 2' 4", with a clothes hanger rod, a high shelf, and a small shelving unit.&nbsp; No other furniture is included.<br
/><br
/>The ceiling height is approximately 10 feet.&nbsp; Moving here from the East Coast, I found this amazing!&nbsp; If you have a lot of stuff, building a (earthquake-safe) loft would be a great move.<br
/><br
/>There's a north-facing window with a heavy curtain.<br
/><br
/>Rent for one person in this room is approximately $900 per month.&nbsp; We split the total rent for the unit according to the size of each bedroom, with an adjustment for common space.&nbsp; We can provide the details of that calculation on request.<br
/><br
/>This $900/mo figure is based on an estimate of how much the unit rent will increase from last year, which is limited by rent control.&nbsp; Rent for the room may change by about $20/mo once the actual figure is known.<br
/><br
/><br
/><h3>The apartment</h3>
<br
/>We're in the Mission at 26th &amp; Bryant. That puts us close to lots of shops and restaurants on 24th Street, as well as a few bus lines.&nbsp; We're about a 15 minute walk from BART, and a short bus or bike ride from Caltrain at 22nd St Station.<br
/><br
/>We have two full bathrooms; the available bedroom is close to both of them.&nbsp; It's also adjacent to the kitchen, which is reasonably large and is equipped with a dishwasher, stove, oven, toaster oven, microwave, and three (!) slow-cookers.<br
/><br
/>The living room is spacious and well-lit with windows on two sides.&nbsp; There's a large L-shaped couch and a dinner table.<br
/><br
/>The TV lives in a separate room which doubles as a guest room.<br
/><br
/>There's a back porch with a beautiful view of Bernal Heights.&nbsp; This is a west-facing view so we also see amazing sunsets on a regular basis.&nbsp; There are stairs down to the backyard, which is shared with the apartment downstairs and contains a hammock and a little greenhouse.&nbsp; There's a cat that hangs out in the backyard (the downstairs neighbors feed it) and we often see mourning doves perched in the trees. &lt;3<br
/><br
/><br
/><h3>Housemates and how we do things</h3>
<br
/>The four of us (three men, one woman) are all in our mid-twenties and we all work in computery / sciency fields.&nbsp; We almost never host wild parties but we'll often have one or two friends over for a relaxed evening.<br
/><br
/>
We have houseguests fairly often, about once a month. We have a house email list so that we all stay in touch nicely; that's how we ask about guests (a "no" is vey rare), and also how we notify each     
other about ideas we have, or things we have bought for the house. We share groceries (you can opt out of this if you like) to encourage each other to make the place somewhere that has food! We do       
this in a very simple and convenient (if you're OK with text files) house accounting system. We also use that to keep track of smaller house purchases, like paper towels or a cleaning service fee.       
<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Some rules we have:                                                                                                                                                                                        <br />
                                                                                                                                                                                                           <br />
* No cats, as we have a housemate who's allergic.                                                                                                                                                          <br />
                                                                                                                                                                                                           <br />
* No smoking indoors, per the lease. We do have that back porch, and back yard.                                                                                                                            <br />
                                                                                                                                                                                                           <br />
We're Greg, Asheesh, Cathy, and Keegan, and we're excited to meet the fifth person who will join us to replace an outgoing housemate! We named the place and gave it a tongue-in-cheek website because     
that's the kind of people we seem to be. Drop us a line if this sounds like fun!
