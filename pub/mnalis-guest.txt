Hi NM,
                                                                                                                                                             
Please accept the request of Matija Nalis to join collab-maint. We are going to work together on the GNU MediaGoblin packaging.
                                                                                                                                                             
I had sent this earlier, but GPG verification failed for you all. It verifies OK for me, curiously, but I'm resending it now. I'll also host it on 
the web at http://asheesh.org/pub/mnalis-guest.txt (verify with http://asheesh.org/pub/mnalis-guest.txt.asc ).
                                                                                                                                                             
I've been working with another non-DD contributor, simonft, and am looking forward to being able to add Matija Nalis to the team.
                                                                                                                                                             
Let me know if you have any questions!
                                                                                                                                                             
Sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                             
Asheesh.
