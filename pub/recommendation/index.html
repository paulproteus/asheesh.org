<b>The Process</b>

<p>Individuals were invited by Shauna to contribute to the letter via <a href="http://www.shaunagm.net/open-source-recommendation/w/Letter">a wiki she set up</a> for the project. After creating the wiki and inviting contributors, Shauna stepped back. She asked Asheesh Laroia and Marina Zhurakhinskaya to edit the contributions into a cohesive and compelling letter.</p>


<p>Asheesh and Marina used the following editing process:</p>

<ul>
<li>They sorted all the comments into <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/shauna-recommendation-letter">categories</a> such as "Shauna the communicator" or "Shauna and technology".</i>
<li>They created an <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/shauna-recommendation-letter-b">outline</a>, with several categories corresponding to each item in the outline.</li>
<li>They wrote the <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/shauna-recommendation-letter-c">letter</a>, splitting up editing duties by paragraph.</li>
<li>Asheesh used HTML tags to produce a <a href="http://htmlpad.org/shauna-recommendation-letter-c/">colorized version</a>, and tweaked the colors and opacity to make them as unobtrusive as possible.</li>
<li>They asked the contributors to check that they were represented accurately and provide the editors with their affiliations.</li>
</ul>
