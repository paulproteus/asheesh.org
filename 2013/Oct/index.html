		<p>I've noticed that there are some tasks that seem important, and for 
which I am happy to invest sporadic effort, but that don't seem to 
repeatedly attract my attention. The obvious one here is my nice 
external disk array for doing backups.
</p><p>By contrast, I've been energized this morning to work on OpenHatch and 
the Open Source Comes to Campus program. Right now I'm a volunteer with 
OpenHatch, not a paid staffer.
</p><p>It feels much more interesting to work on OpenHatch things while Shauna 
is running an event in NYC (and where I can see on IRC and by email the 
activity going on there) than it seems interesting to fix my personal 
storage array. I suspect this relates to my sense of personal meaning 
being intertwined with feeling like I'm part of some activity that other 
people are part of, synchronously.

<p>Today I'd like to quote a passage from one of my favorite books,
<a href="http://open-advice.org/">Open Advice</a>, edited by the astounding
<a href="http://lydiapintscher.de/">Lydia Pintscher</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to quote it because someone helped me with a technical problem today,
and today was definitely a day when I needed it.</p>

<p>This passage is written by Rich Bowen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humility</p>

<p>I had been doing technical support, particularly on mailing lists, for
about two years, when I first started attending technical conferences.
Those first few years were a lot of fun. Idiots would come onto a
mailing list, and ask a stupid question that a thousand other losers
had asked before them. If they had taken even two minutes to just
look, they would have found all the places the question had been
answered before. But they were too lazy and dumb to do that.</p>

<p>Then I attended a conference, and discovered a few things.</p>

<p>First, I discovered that the people asking these questions were
people. They were not merely a block of monospaced black text on
a white background. They were individuals. They had kids. They
had hobbies. They knew so much more than I did about a whole
range of things. I met brilliant people for whom technology was a
tool to accomplish something non-technical. They wanted to share
their recipes with other chefs. They wanted to help children in west
Africa learn how to read. They were passionate about wine, and
wanted to learn more. They were, in short, smarter than I am, and
my arrogance was the only thing between them and further success.</p>

<p>When I returned from that first conference, I saw the users mailing
list in an entirely different light. These were no longer idiots asking
stupid questions. These were people who needed just a little bit of
my help so that they could get a task done, but, for the most part,
their passions were not technology. Technology was just a tool. So if
they did not spend hours reading last yearâ€™s mailing list archives, and
chose instead to ask the question afresh, that was understandable.</p>

<p>And, surely, if on any given day it is irritating to have to help
them, the polite thing to do is to step back and let someone else
handle the question, rather than telling them what an imbecile they
are. And, too, to remember all of the times I have had to ask the
stupid questions.</p>
