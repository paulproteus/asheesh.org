        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/eventbrite.html">New job (what running Debian means to me)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Five weeks ago, I started a new job (Security Engineer, Eventbrite). I accepted the offer on a Friday evening at about 5:30 PM. That evening, my new boss and I traded emails to help me figure 
out what kind of computer I'd like. Time was of the essence because my start date was very next day, Tuesday.
</p><p>I wrote about how I value pixel count, and then RAM, and then a speedy disk, and
then a speedy CPU. I named a few ThinkPad models that could be good, and with advice
from the inimitable <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jared-dominguez">danjared</a>,
I pointed out that some Dell laptops come pre-installed with Ubuntu (which I could
easily swap out for Debian).
</p><p>On Monday, my boss replied. Given the options that the IT department supports, he picked out the best one by my metrics: a MacBook Pro.
The IT department would set up the company-mandated full-disk encryption and anti-virus scanning. If I
wanted to run Linux, I could set up BootCamp or a virtualization solution.
</p><p>As I read the email, my heart nearly stopped. I just <i>couldn't</i> see myself using a Mac.
</p><p>I thought about it. Does it really matter to me enough to call up my boss and undo an IT request
that is already in the works, backpedaling on what I claimed was important to me, opting for
brand anti-loyalty to Apple over hardware speed?
</p><p><i>Yes,</i> I thought to myself. <i>I am willing to just not work there if I have to use a Mac.</i>
</p><p>So I called $BOSS, and I asked, "What can we do to not get me a Mac?" It all worked out fine;
I use a ThinkPad X1 Carbon running Debian for work now, and it absolutely does everything I need.
It does have a slower CPU, fewer pixels, and less RAM, and I am the only person in the San
Francisco engineering office not running Mac OS. But it all works.
</p><p>In the process, I thought it made sense to write up some text to $BOSS. Here is how it goes.
</p>
<blockquote>
Hi $BOSS,<br /><br />
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Thanks for hearing my concerns about having a Mac. It would basically be a fairly serious blow to my self image. It's possible I could rationalize it, but it would take a long time, and I'm not 
sure it would work.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I don't at all need to start work using the computer I'm going to be using for the weeks afterward. I'm OK with using something temporarily that is whatever is available, Mac or non-Mac; I could 
happily borrow something out of the equipment closet in the short term if there are plans in the works to replace it with something else that makes me productive in the long term.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />For full-disk encryption, there are great solutions for this on Linux.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />For anti-virus, it seems Symantec AV is available for Linux &lt;http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=HOWTO17995&gt;.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />It sounds like Apple and possibly Lenovo are the only brands that are available through the IT department, but it is worth mentioning that Dell sells perfectly great laptops with Linux 
pre-installed, such as the XPS 13. I would perfectly happily use that.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />If getting me more RAM is the priority, and the T440s is a bad fit for $COMPANY, then the Lenovo X230 would be a great option, and is noticeably less expensive, and it fits 16GB of RAM.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />BootCamp and the like are theoretical possibilities on Macs, but one worry I have is that if there were a configuration issue, it might not be worth me spending work time to have me fix my 
environment, but instead I would be encouraged for efficiency to use Mac OS, which is well-tested on Apple hardware, and then I would basically hate using my computer, which is a strong emotion, 
but basically how I would feel.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />Another issue (less technical) is that if I took my work machine to the kinds of conferences that I go to, like Debconf, I would find myself in the extremely uncomfortable position of 
advertising for Apple. I am pretty strongly unexcited about doing that.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />Relating to the self-image issue is that it means a lot to me to sort of carry the open source community with me as I do my technical work, even if that technical work is not making more open 
source software. Feeling part of this world that shares software, and Debian in particular where I have a strong feeling of attachment to the community, even while doing something different, is 
part of what makes using computers fun for me. So it clashes with that to use Mac OS on my main machine, or to feel like I'm externally indistinguishable from people who don't care about this 
sort of community.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I am unenthusiastic about making your life harder and looking like a prima donna with my possibly obscure requirements.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I am, however, excited to contribute to $COMPANY!
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I hope that helps! Probably nothing you couldn't have guessed in here, but I thought it was worth spelling some of that out. Happy to talk more.
