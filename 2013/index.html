        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/eventbrite.html">New job (what running Debian means to me)
</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Five weeks ago, I started a new job (Security Engineer, Eventbrite). I accepted the offer on a Friday evening at about 5:30 PM. That evening, my new boss and I traded emails to help me figure 
out what kind of computer I'd like. Time was of the essence because my start date was very next day, Tuesday.
</p><p>I wrote about how I value pixel count, and then RAM, and then a speedy disk, and
then a speedy CPU. I named a few ThinkPad models that could be good, and with advice
from the inimitable <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jared-dominguez">danjared</a>,
I pointed out that some Dell laptops come pre-installed with Ubuntu (which I could
easily swap out for Debian).
</p><p>On Monday, my boss replied. Given the options that the IT department supports, he picked out the best one by my metrics: a MacBook Pro.
The IT department would set up the company-mandated full-disk encryption and anti-virus scanning. If I
wanted to run Linux, I could set up BootCamp or a virtualization solution.
</p><p>As I read the email, my heart nearly stopped. I just <i>couldn't</i> see myself using a Mac.
</p><p>I thought about it. Does it really matter to me enough to call up my boss and undo an IT request
that is already in the works, backpedaling on what I claimed was important to me, opting for
brand anti-loyalty to Apple over hardware speed?
</p><p><i>Yes,</i> I thought to myself. <i>I am willing to just not work there if I have to use a Mac.</i>
</p><p>So I called $BOSS, and I asked, "What can we do to not get me a Mac?" It all worked out fine;
I use a ThinkPad X1 Carbon running Debian for work now, and it absolutely does everything I need.
It does have a slower CPU, fewer pixels, and less RAM, and I am the only person in the San
Francisco engineering office not running Mac OS. But it all works.
</p><p>In the process, I thought it made sense to write up some text to $BOSS. Here is how it goes.
</p>
<blockquote>
Hi $BOSS,<br /><br />
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Thanks for hearing my concerns about having a Mac. It would basically be a fairly serious blow to my self image. It's possible I could rationalize it, but it would take a long time, and I'm not 
sure it would work.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I don't at all need to start work using the computer I'm going to be using for the weeks afterward. I'm OK with using something temporarily that is whatever is available, Mac or non-Mac; I could 
happily borrow something out of the equipment closet in the short term if there are plans in the works to replace it with something else that makes me productive in the long term.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />For full-disk encryption, there are great solutions for this on Linux.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />For anti-virus, it seems Symantec AV is available for Linux &lt;http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=HOWTO17995&gt;.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />It sounds like Apple and possibly Lenovo are the only brands that are available through the IT department, but it is worth mentioning that Dell sells perfectly great laptops with Linux 
pre-installed, such as the XPS 13. I would perfectly happily use that.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />If getting me more RAM is the priority, and the T440s is a bad fit for $COMPANY, then the Lenovo X230 would be a great option, and is noticeably less expensive, and it fits 16GB of RAM.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />BootCamp and the like are theoretical possibilities on Macs, but one worry I have is that if there were a configuration issue, it might not be worth me spending work time to have me fix my 
environment, but instead I would be encouraged for efficiency to use Mac OS, which is well-tested on Apple hardware, and then I would basically hate using my computer, which is a strong emotion, 
but basically how I would feel.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />Another issue (less technical) is that if I took my work machine to the kinds of conferences that I go to, like Debconf, I would find myself in the extremely uncomfortable position of 
advertising for Apple. I am pretty strongly unexcited about doing that.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />Relating to the self-image issue is that it means a lot to me to sort of carry the open source community with me as I do my technical work, even if that technical work is not making more open 
source software. Feeling part of this world that shares software, and Debian in particular where I have a strong feeling of attachment to the community, even while doing something different, is 
part of what makes using computers fun for me. So it clashes with that to use Mac OS on my main machine, or to feel like I'm externally indistinguishable from people who don't care about this 
sort of community.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I am unenthusiastic about making your life harder and looking like a prima donna with my possibly obscure requirements.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I am, however, excited to contribute to $COMPANY!
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
<br /><br />I hope that helps! Probably nothing you couldn't have guessed in here, but I thought it was worth spelling some of that out. Happy to talk more.

<p>For the first time in what feels like years, I wanted to share
something with my friends on Facebook.
</p><p>The background was that I read a note on Slashdot that Linus Torvalds thought
a presidential candidate's remarks on a topic related to airline security were
"moron"ic. So I did my own research, and I disagreed. I figured this was a topic
of general enough interest that all my Facebook friends might be interested in
knowing my position, so I wanted to share that.
</p><p>Facebook didn't let me.
</p><p>I tried first with a link to snopes.com, which blocked me with the
rationale that http://snopes.com/images/template/snopes.gif is "spammy
or unsafe":
</p><p><img src="/pub/image/facebook/snopes-bad.png" alt="You can't post this because it has a blocked link. The content you're trying to share includes a link that's been blocked for being spammy or unsafe. http://snopes.com/images/template/snopes.gif For more information, visit the Help Center. If you think you're seeing this by mistake, please let us know." height="226" width="478" />
</p><p>Then I thought I'd be clever, and I linked to the
<a href="http://coralcdn.org/">.nyud.net</a> version of the snopes page on the topic. I
earned the same message that my post included a blocked link.
</p><p>So then I tried again, with a link to a video on YouTube of the same
clip.
</p><p>That's when I first got the extremely generic message that "The message
could not be posted to this Wall." You can see the animation of what happened
next by hovering below.
</p><p id="img_wrap"><img id="animated" src="/pub/image/censored-on-facebook.gif" height="395" width="738" /><img id="static" src="/pub/image/facebook/censored-on-facebook-0.png" height="395" width="738" />
</p><p>Finally, I removed all the links, and kept the first bit of text. For this,
I got the same generic error: "The message could not be posted to this Wall."
</p><p><b>Update</b>: Patrick points out I should link to the 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43z2NGHS2tI&t=32s">actual video</a>. Here it is, embedded:
</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/43z2NGHS2tI?start=32" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><p>(BTW: The first thing I did was to click "let us know" to indicate that I think I'm seeing 
this by mistake. I filled out the form to indicate there was a problem in an honest, 
respectful way. I got back an email autoresponse that said, "Thanks for taking the time to 
submit this report. While we don't currently provide individual support for this issue, 
this information will help us identify bugs on our site.")

		<p>I've noticed that there are some tasks that seem important, and for 
which I am happy to invest sporadic effort, but that don't seem to 
repeatedly attract my attention. The obvious one here is my nice 
external disk array for doing backups.
</p><p>By contrast, I've been energized this morning to work on OpenHatch and 
the Open Source Comes to Campus program. Right now I'm a volunteer with 
OpenHatch, not a paid staffer.
</p><p>It feels much more interesting to work on OpenHatch things while Shauna 
is running an event in NYC (and where I can see on IRC and by email the 
activity going on there) than it seems interesting to fix my personal 
storage array. I suspect this relates to my sense of personal meaning 
being intertwined with feeling like I'm part of some activity that other 
people are part of, synchronously.

<a href="http://open-advice.org/">Open Advice</a>, edited by the astounding
<a href="http://lydiapintscher.de/">Lydia Pintscher</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to quote it because someone helped me with a technical problem today,
and today was definitely a day when I needed it.</p>

<p>This passage is written by Rich Bowen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humility</p>

<p>I had been doing technical support, particularly on mailing lists, for
about two years, when I first started attending technical conferences.
Those first few years were a lot of fun. Idiots would come onto a
mailing list, and ask a stupid question that a thousand other losers
had asked before them. If they had taken even two minutes to just
look, they would have found all the places the question had been
answered before. But they were too lazy and dumb to do that.</p>

<p>Then I attended a conference, and discovered a few things.</p>

<p>First, I discovered that the people asking these questions were
people. They were not merely a block of monospaced black text on
a white background. They were individuals. They had kids. They
had hobbies. They knew so much more than I did about a whole
range of things. I met brilliant people for whom technology was a
tool to accomplish something non-technical. They wanted to share
their recipes with other chefs. They wanted to help children in west
Africa learn how to read. They were passionate about wine, and
wanted to learn more. They were, in short, smarter than I am, and
my arrogance was the only thing between them and further success.</p>

<p>When I returned from that first conference, I saw the users mailing
list in an entirely different light. These were no longer idiots asking
stupid questions. These were people who needed just a little bit of
my help so that they could get a task done, but, for the most part,
their passions were not technology. Technology was just a tool. So if
they did not spend hours reading last year’s mailing list archives, and
chose instead to ask the question afresh, that was understandable.</p>

<p>And, surely, if on any given day it is irritating to have to help
them, the polite thing to do is to step back and let someone else
handle the question, rather than telling them what an imbecile they
are. And, too, to remember all of the times I have had to ask the
stupid questions.</p>

        <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/scribble/code/linux-3.8-precise.html">Linux 3.8 (or newer) on Ubuntu Precise (12.04)</a>
       </h1>
		
<p>At this time, the latest Linux kernel that has been specially prepared for use with Ubuntu 12.04 is based on Linux 3.8. The rest of this answer is about how to get Linux 3.8 within Ubuntu 12.04.</p>

<p>(Before I get into that, first an aside: you've linked to the "mainline kernel" PPA, a collection of Linux kernel packages that have not been specially tested and prepared by the Ubuntu kernel team. You can read more about <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/162616/should-i-upgrade-to-the-mainline-kernels">mainline kernels here</a>. The mainline kernels are not suggested for installation, except if you are doing tests or you experience a major problem that it can be resolved with a specific mainline kernel.)</p>

<p>The recommended way to get the latest kernel on Ubuntu 12.04 is to stay within Ubuntu 12.04, rather than enabling separate package archives like the PPA you linked to. The latest Ubuntu 12.04 provides special package names to install the more up-to-date packages.</p>

<p>To install them, open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and issue the following commands.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-raring
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-lts-raring
</code></pre>

<p>When the installation completes, you can reboot your system to boot from 3.8 kernel. (The above commands won't uninstall anything (unless your APT is somehow misconfigured), and definitely won't auto-reboot, so you can run the commands and then do the reboot at some later time.)</p>

<p>The bootloader that Ubuntu uses (Grub) lists the newer kernel first, so it will boot from 3.8 automatically (except if you have installed a newer than 3.8) (and except if you know you've customized Grub somehow).</p>

<p>A note about why 3.8: Because of the Long Term Support status of Ubuntu 12.04, many different kernels will be backported (aka specially prepared) from newer versions of Ubuntu. (Additionally, a backported graphics stack (X and related packages) is available.) The 12.04.3 version (that has been released on 22 August 2013) contains the latest kernel and graphics (X) packages from Ubuntu 13.04 (raring). Ubuntu raring has 3.8, so therefore the "backported" version of Linux from raring to precise is also 3.8.</p>

<p>A note about the best way to get an even fresher version, like 3.11: Wait for Ubuntu Saucy (13.10) to come out, and then wait (not very long) for the Ubuntu Long Term Support process to backport that to Precise (12.04). Per the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseSchedule" rel="nofollow">release schedule</a>, Saucy should be out on October 17. Then you will be able to install linux-image-generic-lts-saucy!</p>

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>My old housemate Will emailed me saying he wanted to get a second wifi router to use
as a repeater. I realized that I haven't written my standard recommendation down ever,
just repeatedly used it to great success. So, here it is:
</p><p>My general recommendation here is to build your own "wifi repeater" out of two "wifi routers",
rather than buying something that calls itself a repeater. It relies on Ethernet
bridging rather than any advanced wifi technology, which in my opinion makes it easy
to diagnose.
</p>

                       |   second wifi router  (DISABLE DHCP on internal network on 2nd rtr)
                       +----------------------------------------------------------+--------+
</pre>
<p>If you don't want to do ethernet over powerline between them, you can do regular old
Ethernet.
</p><p>Crucially, you must disable DHCP for the second wifi router. Then anyone on the second
network will have their DHCP broadcasts answered by the first wifi router.
</p><p>Also you should manually set the admin IP on the second router to something like
192.168.1.2 if the main network uses 192.168.1.1 as the admin IP address.
</p><p>Do not connect the second network's uplink port to anything.
</p><p>It doesn't really matter if you set the ESSID (network name) of both networks to be the
same or different. I would gently recommend setting them to be the same, and have the
same key, so people's laptops can happily roam between them.
</p><p>Note also that if you need wired network connectivity for computers near "2nd router",
any computers you plug into the "port 1-4" ports will work fine. And the choice of port 1
on "Main wifi router" and "port 3" for "second wifi router" as the connection points
is totally arbitrary.
</p><p>Happy wifi-ing!

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>This morning, I was trying to decrease the amount of email in my inbox. I had a few messages with
subjects like:
</p>
<ul><li> comment on http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/freed-software
</li><li> comment on http://www.asheesh.org/note/sysop/comments
</li><li> comment on http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/freed-software
</li></ul>
<p>But all the comments in this case were spam. I'm using an Akismet API plugin
for pyblosxom, but that has a few shortcomings. Like anything else, it misses
some spam, but moreover, it doesn't help me find and remove old spam comments
in bulk.
</p><p>My pattern with email is basically to ignore it for a while, and then deal with
it in bulk, sometimes missing messages from the past. The result is that I have
often missed these comment notifications, and it was a bit of a drag to figure out
which comments I had dealt with already.
</p><p>So I wrote a small tool this morning. Here is how it works:
</p>
<ul><li> It loops over the comments directory.
</li><li> A script reads each comment and prints it to standard out in mailbox format, piping the message to spambayes for processing.
</li><li> The main script shows me spambayes' guess as to if the message is spam, as well as spambayes' certainty, and asks me to confirm. If I confirm it is spam, it asks if I want to delete it. (If it notices spambayes got it wrong, it retrains spambayes.)
</li><li> After I have dealt with the comment, it creates a stamp file next to the comment so that it won't ask me about that the next time I run the tool.
</li></ul>
<p>Voila! A spam moderation queue with artificial intelligence.
</p><p>You can find it here, on my Github account: <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus/spambayes-pyblosxom">https://github.com/paulproteus/spambayes-pyblosxom</a>
</p><p>Permission to re-use the code is granted under the terms of CC Zero or Apache License 2.0, at your option.
</p><p>Moreover, now I believe there are zero spam comments left lying around this blog!

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>Preeya and I cooked together at <a href="http://pointlesstopology.com/">my place</a> yesterday, and
after the event, I wrote down some notes so that next time it can be even better.
</p><p>The idea of the cooking was to create leftovers for us both to eat during the work-week.
Preeya's angle is that she loses interest in eating something during cooking it,
so we thought we could make food for each other.
</p><p>We cooked:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2008/10/crockpot-recipe-for-vegetarian-black.html">Crockpot Recipe for Vegetarian Black Bean and Tomatillo Soup with Lime and Cilantro</a> (for Asheesh, by Preeya)
</li><li> <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/dinner-recipe-slow-cooker-gree-134303">Slow Cooker Coconut & Green Curry Pork</a> (for Preeya, by Asheesh)
</li></ul>
<h2 id="w_notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Here are the notes I wrote up from the event. Mostly I'm sharing these to 
provide some insight into the process of "Do something in the kitchen, then 
think about how to improve the kitchen" that I've been going through a lot 
lately.
</p>
<h3 id="w_dry-things-we-could-have-had-but-didnt">Dry things we could have had but didn't</h3>
<ul><li> Brown rice
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Black beans
</li></ul>
<p>(Fix: bought them by Google Shopping Express)
</p>
<ul><li> Canned diced tomatoes... (reading http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=25627 suggests Hunt's is good; fix is to stock a few cans. I should get that from a local store since Google Shopping Express doesn't have Hunt's. Muir Glen Organic is also good, says this. Personal note: Jersey Fresh brand is super great, but hard to get.)
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_locations-of-things-in-kitchen">Locations of things in kitchen</h3>
<ul><li> Scissors were easy to use once Asheesh said where they were.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Counter space was not cleared-off before we began.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Oven gloves were in a weird spot. (Fix: I moved two magnetic hooks
</li></ul>
<ul><li> We didn't have a garlic press, which would have been nice. (Fix: I did some research and bought http://www.amazon.com/Zyliss-Susi-3-Garlic-Press/dp/B007D3V00Q/ . Note that this press does not need one to peel the clove, which is good news.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Now that the 5lb gag of basmati is open, I'm afraid it'll get infested with moths. (Fix: Buy a 1 gallon Mason jar and see if I can fit all the rice into that.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Some spices aren't in the "spice rack" (but there's a fix already in the works for that, awaiting delivery of more spice jars).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Preeya didn't know where chopping boards were, though they were easy to get once found.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> We tried two different locations for Preeya's slow cooker, settling on to the right of the sink / underneath the window there.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_shopping">Shopping</h3>
<ul><li> The pork butt was very reasonably priced, but it meant round-tripping to Mission Street for Preeya's favorite meat market. Asheesh could have tried La Gallinita next time.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Buying the rest of things was easy. Casa Lucas had everything, I think.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_general">General</h3>
<ul><li> Things in the slow cooker take ages to cool down.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> We don't have any tupperware large enough to fit a full 4 quart slow cooker cooking result.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The programmable-ness is super nice in Preeya's slow cooker.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Using our can opener on the Maesri curry paste just sucks.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Preeya had to go back to her place to get her slow cooker, which we could have thought of.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Preeya mentioned the <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/BonJour-Mezzaluna-Cutting-Board-Set/6655120/product.html?cid=202290&kid=9553000357392&track=pspla&ef_id=UNNylAAAQ7-u91Ut:20130512171403:s">Mezzaluna</a> style of cutting board, which has a dome to rock a knife within, for dicing. (Other names for similar things: ulus, uluut.) Such a thing might be worth getting.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_recipe">Recipe</h3>
<ul><li> The rice in the recipe for Asheesh became mush. Should probably have stuck to brown rice.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Asheesh thought he'd add spinach to Preeya's recipe but hasn't yet.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="w_logistics">Logistics</h3>
<ul><li> It was nice cooking together. The scheduling was somewhat messy. We could have pre-picked our recipes. Preeya didn't bring a computer so only Asheesh really looked.
</li></ul>

http://asheesh.org/scratch/.
</p><p>Then OpenHatch happened in May 2009, and I paid decreasing attention to that site.
</p><p>Eventually, as a semi-unprotected MediaWiki instance, it became spammed to smithereens.
</p><p>Last night and this morning, I did the following things:
</p>
<ul><li> Made it so only sysops can edit the site.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Clicked every link off the front page, and manually reverted it to the most recent non-vandalized page I could find.
</li></ul>
<p>Now you can more easily read my scratchy notes, like:

<p>As it happens, I synchronized all my email using Dovecot dsync,
so I could do this on my laptop.
</p><p>Then I just ran:

</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;fijal&gt; paulproteus: if you have a second, can you tell me *why* are you doing all of this?
</blockquote>
<p>Briefly, here is the reason I work on <a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>:
</p><p>For free software to take over the world, and for all users of software to be able to have control over their computing, we need a few things it seems to me.
</p>
<ol><li> Software that <i>is</i> free ought to be better.
</li><li> That will probably take more collaboration and contributors.
</li><li> More people ought to feel comfortable doing things like filing bugs and participating in projects.
</li><li> For people to understand that, it helps a great deal if they know how to program.
</li><li> Free software contribution experiences are best when you have in-person communities to work with and bounce ideas off, or at least people who you know fairly well even if you collaborate remotely.
</li></ol>
<p>I think that explains basically all of what we do at OpenHatch.

</a>
       </h1>
		<p>I just tried to despam a mediawiki instance with git-remote-mediawiki.
</p><p>The idea is as follows:
</p>
<ul><li> Use <a href="https://github.com/Bibzball/Git-Mediawiki/wiki/User-manual">git-remote-mediawiki</a> to clone the wiki into a local git repo.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Make a list of bad users, either by skimming Special:RecentChanges, or by some other more automated means. For example, use 'git log' to get everyone since the last time you felt the wiki was clean:
</li></ul>
<pre>git log --since='Wed Dec 5 22:57:06 2012 +0000'
</pre>
<p>(You can process that with either 'grep ^Author' and so on, or you can use an <a href="https://github.com/openhatch/oh-antispam/blob/master/wikispam/handle_spam.py">overwrought Python script</a> I wrote.)
</p>
<ul><li> Get a list of their commits:
</li></ul>
<pre>git log --author=bad_user_1 --author=bad_user_2 --pretty="format:%H"
</pre>
<p>Here's where things start to go wrong.
</p><p>You might try to revert them all:
<pre>git log --author=bad_user_1 --author=bad_user_2 --pretty="format:%H" |
xargs -n1 git revert
</pre>
<p>That works great until the first merge conflict.
</p><p>So then you write a wrapper script that does "git revert $1 || git revert --abort",
and you can still only revert the first few hundred (out of ~800) spam edits because
one of the commits causes a conflict when you try to revert it.
</p><p>Why a conflict? I suspect it's because there are spam edits that I neglected to 
include in the revert stream. (<b>Update</b>: The conflict was actually a real conflict --
some kind soul on the web had already reverted a bunch of the spam edits!)
</p><p>In our case, there are fairly few <i>pages</i> getting spammed, so it'd be simpler to 'git 
log' the pages we care about and revert back to the commit IDs that look clean. 'git 
revert' could still be useful in the case of tangled history, but (apparently) there 
is a limit to how useful it can be, anyway.
</p><p>Oh, also:
</p><p>It'd be useful to be able to create MediaWiki dump files from git-remote-mediawiki 
exports. That way, I could use 'git rebase -i' to clean up history. (That would break 
links *unless* the MediaWiki revision IDs somehow stayed constant for the revisions
with the same content. Maybe that's feasible. Actually, the simplest way might be
to write a tool that filters the dump file itself, rather than exporting straight from
git-remote-mediawiki.)
</p><p>Also also, I <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/215740">fixed a format string bug</a> in
git mergetool, one of my favorite little pieces of git.
</p><p>P.S. In this corpus, of the IP address editors (i.e., not logged in), 0 (of 16) 
are spammers. About 80% of the logged-in editors are spammers. (Admittedly our wiki does
require you to log in if you are posting new URLs to a page.)
</p><p><b>Update</b>: It is <i>way</i> faster if you run it with low latency to the MediaWiki server
in question. It probably could be adjusted to make fewer API calls, and to make more of them
in parallel.

<p>This is the most beautiful piece of mail I have ever received virtually:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/scribble/travel/111771273587_page_1.jpeg" width="576"></p>

<p>Since a few months ago, I have been a very happy customer of <a href="http://www.virtualpostmail.com/">Virtual Post Mail</a>,
a service where they'll receive mail on my behalf and, if I want them to, scan it. And if there
is a check inside, they'll send it to my bank's "Deposit by mail" address so it gets
into my bank account.</p>

<p>I've been using it for a number of OpenHatch inbound mail things, so that I
don't have to go deposit checks at a bank branch if e.g. I'm traveling. But I've
also been using it for a few personal things.</p>

<p>I suspect this is a wedding invitation. I've clicked the "Open and Scan" button
in the website, and expect to find out shortly (in 1-24 hours).</p>
